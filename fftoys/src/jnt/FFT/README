README for jnt.FFT
 Java Numerical Toolkit subpackage for Fast Fourier Transforms.
 Bruce R. Miller <bruce.miller@nist.gov>

***NOTE***
Several routines in this subpackage were derived from
Brian Gough's FFT routines in the Gnu Scientific Library (GSL).
GSL is released under the Gnu General Public License
  (see http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html)
As such, this package must also be released under GPL.

The modifications I have made to port the routines from
C to Java,  and the additional classes developed were
developed as part of my official duties as a U.S. 
government employee, and are therefore not subject
to copyright.

Furthermore, this software is under development, and is
in no way certified or guaranteed.
