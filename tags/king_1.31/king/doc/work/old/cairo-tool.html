<center><h1>The C-alpha Hinges tool</h1></center>
The Hinges tool is used to adjust segments of protein backbone without disturbing the surrounding structure.
It allows you to select a region of backbone that joins two alpha carbons,
and then rotate that segment of backbone around an axis drawn between those C-alphas.
Using Hinges requires that <code>chiropraxis.jar</code> be present in the same folder as <code>king.jar</code>.

<p>Create a hinge by control-clicking the alpha carbons that act as its endpoints or anchors.
To use the dial control, click and drag the pointer to the desired value.
For finer control you can shift-drag along an imaginary slider (this behavior is somewhat like the virtual dials in O).
To reset the dial to its starting value, double click the dial face.
The dial can also be adjusted from the graphics window using the mouse wheel or arrow keys; see below.
<p>The Hinges panel provides feedback on the geometric quality of the current model,
displaying residues names, deviation of the tau angle (N-CA-C) from ideality, and
the position of the residue on the Ramachandran plot (phi, psi, and favored/allowed/outlier).
Deviant geometry is highlighted in red.
<p>This tool relies on the naming convention established by Prekin to find
the appropriate part of the PDB structure from the point ID encoded in the kinemage.
Future versions may use a spatial relationship instead, but that is not yet implemented.
<p>Hinges is able to call Probe to dynamically generate contact dot surfaces as the model is moved.
Using this feature requires that your OS can find Probe (typically, that Probe be on your PATH and be named 'probe').

<p>More documentation is planned for future releases.

<i>Normal</i> means the left-most mouse button.
<br>The middle mouse button acts like Normal+Ctrl.
<br>The right mouse button acts like Normal+Shift.
<br>The left and right mouse buttons together act like Normal+Shift+Ctrl (only when dragging).
