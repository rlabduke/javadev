<H2><A NAME="ss5.1">5.1</A> <A HREF="king-manual.html#toc5.1">Saving kinemages</A>
</H2>

<P>You can save traditional kinemages using the <CODE>File | Save as</CODE> menu;
these files are typically given the extension <CODE>.kin</CODE>. The resulting
kinemage file will be plain text that you can view and even edit
by hand using any text editor (though of course you don't have to!).
If you choose to do this and want use a word processor (like Microsoft
Word), make sure that you load and save the file in plain text format.</P>

<P>Note that due to the security restrictions that web browsers
place on Java applets, saving will never be possible when KiNG is
running inside a web browser.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss5.2">5.2</A> <A HREF="king-manual.html#toc5.2">Printing kinemages</A>
</H2>

<P>You can use <CODE>File | Print</CODE> to send the image in the graphics area
to your printer. The image will fill as much of the page as possible
without distorting it. The relative size of the elements will be
exactly the same as on screen. Among the consequences of this are
that an image printed from a small graphics window will have thicker
lines when printed than will the image when printed from a larger
graphics window. Don't worry about this too much; just remember printing
is WYSIWYG (what-you-see-is-what-you-get). If it looks right on the
screen, it should look right on the paper! Some images will fit better
in landscape mode than portrait mode; this decision is left up to
the user.</P>

<P>Printing should work even when KiNG is running in a web browser,
although the user will generally be asked for permission first.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss5.3">5.3</A> <A HREF="king-manual.html#toc5.3">Exporting as PostScript, PDF, <EM>etc.</EM></A>
</H2>

<P>Rather than sending the image to the printer, it can be captured
for inclusion in a publication or later manipulation in a graphics
program like Adobe Illustrator. The method of doing this is somewhat
dependent on your system.</P>

<P>Under Linux, choosing <CODE>Print to file</CODE> from the Print dialog will
generate a PostScript file, which can be converted many other formats
using <EM>e.g.</EM> Ghostscript tools like <CODE>ps2pdf</CODE> (PDF, Portable Document
Format) and <CODE>ps2epsi</CODE> (EPS, Encapsulated PostScript). Printing to a
file may not be possible when KiNG is running as an applet in a web
page.</P>

<P>With Macintosh OS X, both PostScript and PDF output are supported
directly from the Print dialog. Nice and easy!</P>

<P>Under Microsoft Windows, things don't seem to be as straightforward.
One possiblity is to install the generic PostScript printer drivers
from Adobe, 
<A HREF="http://www.adobe.com">http://www.adobe.com</A>, and then direct this "virtual printer" to FILE (rather
than, <EM>e.g.</EM>, LPT1). This should allow you to generate PostScript output.
Adobe's Acrobat program (the full version, the one you have to pay
for) may provide a similar virtual printer for creating PDF files.
Your mileage may vary; I'd be interested in hearing about better
ways to do this from any Windows experts out there.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss5.4">5.4</A> <A HREF="king-manual.html#toc5.4">Exporting as XML</A>
</H2>

<P>You can export kinemages in XML format using the Kinetic Image
Markup Language by choosing <CODE>Kin-XML</CODE> from the <CODE>File | Export</CODE> menu.
We recommend giving these files the extension <CODE>.xkn</CODE> or <CODE>.xml</CODE>. At this
time, KiNG does not read these files, nor do other kinemage viewers.
Also, they may not include all of the information that would be present
in a traditional kinemage file. However, for people who would like
to operate on the data from a kinemage without having to write a
parser for the kinemage format, we expect this will be useful and
convenient. Translation from the modified XML back to kinemage format
is left as an exercise to the reader ;)</P>
