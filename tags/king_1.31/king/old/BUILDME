BUILDME file for KiNG
=====================

KiNG is built using Apache Ant, which stores its configuration in build.xml.
Ant is the standard build tool for Java projects, like 'make' is for C/C++.
It is written in Java and works cross-platform, anywhere that Java does.
You can obtain Ant for free at 
    http://ant.apache.org
These build files were written to work with Ant 1.5.2; if you have a newer
version, there may have been some changes to the file structure.

To build the JAR and all the classfiles, rename the king-xxxx-src and
driftwood-xxxx-src directories to 'king' and 'driftwood', respectively. Then
enter the king directory and type 'ant'. The necessary Driftwood libraries
will be built automatically, followed by compilation of the KiNG code,
followed by the creation of king.jar (which contains class files and
resources from both trees of code, as well as from the gnu.regexp package
included in the 'lib' directory).
