### 0.13 ###
- found and squashed a fencepost bug in CrystalVertexSource.evaluateVertex()
  that caused ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsExceptions in CVS.getValue()

### 0.12 ###
- migrated to building with Apache Ant (ant.apache.org)

### 0.11 ###
- moved from util.isosurface to driftwood.isosurface
- made most fields in CrystalVertexSource public
- watch for OutOfMemoryError in OMap b/c no way to recognize DSN6 format

### 0.10 ###
- renamed DSN6VertexSource to OMapVertexSource
- resolved how cell edges are handled in O maps (padded to 8x8x8)
- added support for Brix maps from O
- added another BufferedInputStream to constructor to fix the broken
  mark() method in GZIPInputStream. (submitted to Sun)

### 0.09 ###
- added findVertexForPoint() to VertexLocator
- modified MMC.march() to deal with NaN from VertexEvaluators
- implemented findVertexForPoint() for CrystalVertexSource
- added auto-detect/auto-gunzip to XplorVertexSource for gzipped map files
- fixed problem reading O maps -- every byte pair is transposed
- added auto-gzip to DSN6VertexSource

### 0.08 ###
- O maps work but are of low quality with many artifacts
- Try supports color, map format switches
- I've tried many variations on the O format, but it's still not right
  I don't know what to do at this point...
- Using MapMan to convert DSN6 to XPLOR and then rendering gives
  perfect results, which are different from the source O-map.
  I must still not understand the format completely.

### 0.07 ###
- it looks like non-orthogonal unit cell axes are now supported properly.
  YAY!!!
- reorganized code somewhat to combine (hopefully) common functions in
  CrystalVertexSource
- began work on DSN6VertexSource to support O maps
  
### 0.06 ###
- support for non-orthogonal axes (in progress)

### 0.05 ###
- fixed bugs in XplorVertexSource.nextValue()
- added bin wrapping to XplorVertexSource.{evaluate,locate}Vertex()
- realized locateVertex() shouldn't do wrapping after all. (D'oh!)

### 0.04 ###
- wrote KinfileEdgePlotter
- started XplorVertexSource
- fixed fencepost bug in MMC.march()
- fixed cube cases #23 and #108; regenerated kin files

### 0.03 ###
- wrote MeshMarchingCubes

### 0.02 ###
- defined EdgePlotter, VertexLocator, VertexEvaluator

### 0.01 ###
- created kinemages, built marching cubes lookup table
