This little demo plugin for KiNG was written by Andrea Mantler <mantler@cs.unc.edu> to illustrate the basics of writing a plugin for KiNG.  Instructions:1.  Download the KiNG source from:	http://kinemage.biochem.duke.edu/software/index.phpand read the KiNG source instructions.2.  Place the DemoPlugin folder in the "king" folder (the one that contains the "king", "driftwood", etc. subfolders).3.  Use ant to compile DemoPlugin.  Note that the default build option is set to "build", not "deploy-local".  The "deploy-local" option works on my mac, but may need to be changed for your system.  4.  Run KiNG, and play with the fun little Demo Plugin (found in the tools menu).5.  Use this plugin and "Hacking KiNG" to write your own plugin.Enjoy!
