README file for KiNG
====================

KiNG is a program for viewing and interacting with three-dimensional
illustrations in "kinemage" format. This file describes how to run KiNG
and serves as a guide to the other resources in this distribution.

More information on kinemage graphics and their uses in structural biology
and in teaching 3-D literacy is available from the homepage of the
Richardson laboratory at Duke University:
    http://kinemage.biochem.duke.edu/

To run KiNG, simply double-click on the file named 'king.jar'. On most
systems, this will launch the Java interpretter and run KiNG -- after
a few seconds, the KiNG window(s) should appear on your screen. KiNG works
on any platform that provides a modern (1.3+) Java Virtual Machine; at
the moment, that includes Windows, Apple's OS X, Linux (x86 only), and
Solaris. YOU MUST HAVE JAVA INSTALLED IN ORDER FOR KING TO RUN!!! For more
information on Java, or to obtain a free copy of the latest release, visit
    http://java.sun.com/

Unix types may want to create a shell script to launch KiNG on their system;
it should look something like this:
    #!/bin/sh
    exec java -jar /home/ian/bin/jars/king.jar "$@"
Just enter those two lines into a text file named 'king' (no leading spaces,
please), run the command 'chmod 755 king', and then move it to someplace
that's on your PATH -- maybe '/usr/local/bin' or '~/bin'.

KiNG features a relatively complete user's guide that is accessible from the
Help menu. Individual tools in the Toolbox also have their own documentation.
For those who prefer hard copies, the doc/ directory contains a PDF of the
manual and may contain other relevant documentation as well.

KiNG and most contents of this distribution are covered by the terms of the
license found in the 'LICENSE' file. Other libraries and resources bundled
as part of the distribution are governed by their own terms as described
in the user manual.
