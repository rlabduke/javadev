<center><h1>The Electron Density Map plugin</h1></center>
This tool is for viewing electron density maps while exploring kinemages of crystal structures.
(If that doesn't mean anything to you, then you probably don't need this plugin.)
<p>Choose "Open" from the Tools menu in order to open a map file.
Both X-PLOR (ASCII, not binary) and O (DSN6 or Brix) maps are supported.
<p>Each map opens a new control window, which allows adjustment of its extent, color, and level.
The segment of map that is visible at any given time is centered in the current view;
when the view changes, the portion that is visible will automatically be updated.
<p>Any dynamic segment of map can be "captured" as part of a static kinemage;
just use the Export button to make the currently visible map segment part of the current kinemage.
When you've finished with a map, be sure to Discard it to free up the memory it consumed.
<p>If you don't have an electron density map for the structure you're interested in, you can try
looking at the Uppsala Electron Density Server (http://fsrv1.bmc.uu.se/eds/). They offer standard
maps for many of the structures deposited in the Protein Data Bank (http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/).
<p>Maps can't be loaded from the local filesystem when KiNG is running as an applet due to security restrictions.
However, you can use the XMAP or OMAP parameter along with the &lt;PARAM&gt; tag to load a (single) map from a URL.
For example: <code>&lt;PARAM name="omap" value="http://example.com/electron/density/my-protein.dsn6.gz"&gt;</code>
<p>You can also use the EDMAPBASE and EDMAPLIST parameters to allow the user to select and load a map.
EDMAPBASE specifies a path to the maps relative to the current document base URL.
EDMAPLIST is a space-separated list of filenames that can be loaded from that path.
Users can also enter and modify URLs directly, though obviously this isn't very convenient.
