<H2><A NAME="ss4.1">4.1</A> <A HREF="king-manual.html#toc4.1">Editing text</A>
</H2>

<P>The text of a kinemage is often critical for clarifying and amplifying
its meaning. It's analogous to the caption that accompanies a printed
figure. You can edit the kinemage text in the same window that you
use for reading it (just press the <CODE>Show text</CODE> button).</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss4.2">4.2</A> <A HREF="king-manual.html#toc4.2">Editing views</A>
</H2>

<P>One simple editing tool is <CODE>Views | Save current view</CODE>, which records
the current orientation and position of the kinemage as a new view
in the <CODE>Views</CODE> menu. Creating a series of meaningful, clearly labeled
views is a great way to make a kinemage more informative. You can
delete, rename, and rearrange views using <CODE>Views | Edit saved views</CODE>.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss4.3">4.3</A> <A HREF="king-manual.html#toc4.3">The hierarchy editor</A>
</H2>

<P>One of the goals of KiNG is to enable simple, visual editing
of most parts of a kinemage. Many of the editing commands are activated
using a tree-like display of the hierarchical kinemage structure,
which will resemble the layout of buttons.</P>

<P>The structure of the kinemage can be rearranged by cutting and
pasting elements, creating new elements and deleting unneeded ones,
and reordering elements (using the <CODE>Up</CODE> and <CODE>Down</CODE> commands). Play with
these commands, and their operation will soon become obvious. Elements
can even be cut out of one kinemage and pasted into another!</P>

<P>Also, the properties of individual elements can be adjusted,
which allows them to be renamed. What other properties are available
depends on the level of the hierarchy (kinemage, group, subgroup,
or list). Each element can also be toggled on and off, even if it
doesn't have a button visible in the button pane.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss4.4">4.4</A> <A HREF="king-manual.html#toc4.4">Other editing commands</A>
</H2>

<P>More editing features are planned for a future version of KiNG,
including editing of masters and colors.</P>
