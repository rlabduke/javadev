<H2><A NAME="ss2.1">2.1</A> <A HREF="king-manual.html#toc2.1">Opening a file</A>
</H2>

<P>To open a new kinemage, go the the <CODE>File</CODE> menu and choose <CODE>Open</CODE>.
Browse through your file system and find a kinemage file. These files
typically end in .<CODE>kin</CODE>, though ones that have been edited extensively
may have revisions named .<CODE>kip</CODE>, <CODE>kip1</CODE>, <CODE>kip2</CODE>, <EM>etc</EM>. Click the button
marked OK and KiNG will begin loading the file. You'll see a progress
bar as KiNG loads the contents of the file, and then the first kinemage
in that file will be displayed in the graphics area (where the logo
used to be).</P>

<P>Files can also be specified on the command line, as in <CODE>king&nbsp;-s&nbsp;foo.kin&nbsp;bar.kip1</CODE>,
which will load all the kinemages in those two files upon startup.
The <CODE>-s</CODE> (or <CODE>-single</CODE>) flag is required so that KiNG knows not to merge
the two files together.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss2.2">2.2</A> <A HREF="king-manual.html#toc2.2">Working with multiple kinemages</A>
</H2>

<P>If your file has more than one kinemage, you can choose which
one you want to look at from the drop box on the right, just above
the buttons. You can also use <CODE>File</CODE> | <CODE>Open</CODE> to load additional files;
those kinemages will also appear in the drop box. When you're done,
use <CODE>File</CODE> | <CODE>Close</CODE> to get rid of the current kinemage, or use <CODE>File</CODE>
| <CODE>Close all</CODE> to get rid of all the open kinemages.</P>

<P>Sometimes you want to combine the contents of multiple kinemages.
You might want to combine a graph of your latest sales data with
some nicely formated and labeled axes you prepared last month. Or
maybe you want to combine a ribbon drawing of your favorite protein
with a representation of the atomic detail at its active site. In
either case, using <CODE>File</CODE> | <CODE>Merge</CODE> will combine the contents of a new
file with the contents of the currently displayed kinemage. Be careful
--- if the new file contains multiple kinemages, they'll <EM>all</EM> be merged
into the current one!</P>

<P>This behavior can be achieved on the command line by specifying
multiple files, as in <CODE>king&nbsp;-m&nbsp;foo.kin&nbsp;bar.kip1</CODE>, which will merge all
the kinemages in those two files upon startup. The <CODE>-m</CODE> (or <CODE>-merge</CODE>)
flag is optional; merging multiple files is the default behavior.</P>
