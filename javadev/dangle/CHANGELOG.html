==============================================================================
===  TO DO  ==================================================================
==============================================================================
    do base-P distance, etc   <-- what could "etc" mean?... -->
    GUI for defining measures?
    new func? avgall() should call getAll() instead of get() on AtomSpecs
    different selenoMet bond lengths & angles?
    expand "isprepro" to generic "ispre AAA"?
    determine SSs geometrically if no SSBOND headers avail (or even if so)?
    output residue info for both ends of SSs?
    base-P perp devs in geom kin

==============================================================================
### 1.04 ### keedy
- Allowed "for" to be followed by multiple specifiers, e.g. "for deoxy 2'",
  and to apply to any resname by default if none specified, as opposed to before
  where a residue name was strictly required.
- Replaced kludgy ignoreDNA/RNA variables with "for oxy/rna" and "for deoxy/
  dna", so "-rna -dna" is now handled logically.
- Hard coded "for oxy/rna" and "for deoxy/dna" into Parkinson & Gelbin resource
  files as well as dnabb and rnabb builtins.
- Revamped parsing of -res=#,#-#,... flag to allow a sequence of ranges.
- Builtin chi3 now works on selenoMet (has 'SE  ' atom).
- Added disulfide support: "for disulf", "disulfides"/"disulf"/"ss" 
  superbuiltin, chi2',chi1',phi',psi' builtins, alternate chi2/3 defs, ...
- Made geom kin springs & fans unpickable (Jane's request via Vince)
- Added balls for Cbeta devs >0.25A to geometry kin output
- Implemented Prekin-like aa type specificity for cbdev builtin; both programs 
  now output the same numbers
- Changed some geom kin flags (mainly deleted them to make things cleaner!)
- Made Dangle automatically pull build # out of buildnum.props
...
- Made Dangle only deploy Disulfide info to Models if any Measurements 
  actually involve disulfides
- Added some modified bases to RNA residue "whitelist" for Swati
...
- Fixed bug with Disulfide prep (see above)
- Added alternative chi definition for FHU and PSU (different base atoms)

### 1.03 ###
gjk
- Added Gelbin....DNA.txt to resources (source file for DNA parameters)
- Modified Dangle.java to incorporate DNA instead of skipping it
keedy
- Fixed bug where "-dna" also evaluated RNA.  Now, "-dna" ignores RNA and 
  "-rna" ignores DNA.  Both simultaneously evaulates both but (WARNING!) 
  still acts weird, especially with "-validate" or "-outliers"!
- Added "dnabb" superbuiltin analogous to "rnabb"
- Made Dangle.java automatically pull version # out of version.props
- Minor readability changes

### 1.02 ### keedy
- Added builtins like cbdev - hadev, nhdev, codev - for diagnosing RDC-based
  peptide distortions

### 1.01 ### keedy
- Added infrastructure for "for 2'" additions to the Parkinson RNA
  resource file (pucker-specific bond lengths and angles)
- Also set up for future incorp'n of "for deoxy ..." DNA ideal values

### 1.00 ### keedy
- Made Dangle its own program & package separate from chiropraxis
