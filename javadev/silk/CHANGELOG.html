==============================================================================
===  TO DO  ==================================================================
==============================================================================
    Suport -sigdig flag
    Write command line help
    Write README, instructions, etc.
    Create SilkGui
    Add a NDimTable.writeText() with default parameters
    Allow "energy" conversion to be done at user-specified temperature?
 ** Look for other modulo code that suffers from this bug!! (LOTS of % symbols...)
    Allow NDimTable_Dense to read text files with "x y z 0.0" lines dropped
        Move writeText() to NDimTable itself (shared impl)
  * Figure out how hill climb switches should work...

===  CHANGE LOG  =============================================================
==============================================================================

### 0.90 ###
- split NDimTable into abstract base class plus _Dense and _Sparse variants
  in preparation for trying the 7-D RNA backbone rotamers problem.
- pre-existing bug in wrapbin() -- this made previous results slightly wrong?
- finished out most functions in sparse (except i/o); we now allow rehashing

### 0.84 ###
- created KarplusTableToNDFT
- added documentation for Vince in the form of an OmniGraffle flowchart
- added "energy" postop for converting energies from probabilities

### 0.83 ###
- fixed bug in NDFT reading that zeroed out realcount for no reason.
- added ability to read back in the text data files that are written out.
- tested text read/write: output is identical to input
- created the silk.util package for task-specific helper programs
- created util.RotamerSampling for Homme's rotamer sampling task

### 0.82 ###
- accounted for merger of driftwood.string into driftwood.util

### 0.81 ###
- made TabDataLoader ignore lines starting with hash (#)
- fixed bug in SilkEngine where halfwidth and weight parameters to
  tallyGaussian and tallyCosine were reversed.
- same bug in SilkEngine.processDensityDependent
- started KinfilePlotter
- added wrapData() to SilkEngine
- made SilkEngine actually obey the -scale switch
- bundled with Top500-Angles package

### 0.80 ###
- created most classes
- started reworking NDFloatTable ==> NDimTable
- added recursiveCount to NDimTable
- wrote SilkOptions
- wrote DataSample
- wrote TabDataLoader
- wrote SilkCmdLine
- wrote SilkEngine
