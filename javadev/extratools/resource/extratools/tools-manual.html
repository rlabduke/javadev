1.1 Dock 3-on-3: Geometric construction
</H1>

<P>
The three-point docking tool is useful for constructing geometric
shapes and figures out of existing pieces in kinemage format. As you
start picking points with the mouse, they will be labeled with numbers:
first three points in the reference frame, then three in the mobile
frame. When you're ready to apply the docking transformation, turn
off groups that should remain in place and leave visible those that
should move. Then press the <TT>Dock</TT> button. The first points
will be superimposed exactly, the 1-2 axes will be aligned (so that
the mobile ``points in the direction of'' the reference) and the
final points are used to determine rotational position (dihedral angle)
about the 1-2 axis.

<P>
If you'd like to dock several of the same object with respect to each
other, remember you can use the copy and paste commands in the hierarchy
editor to create duplicate objects.

1.2 Least-Squares Docking: Getting the best fit
</H1>

<P>
The least-squares docking tool is useful for matching up two objects
that are similar but not quite the same. As you start picking points
with the mouse, they will be labeled with numbers, defining the Reference
frame. Once you've selected something to dock onto, you should choose
the Mobile frame and add an equal number of points to it. The order
matters: 1 will match with 1, 2 with 2, and so on. When you're ready
to apply the docking transformation, turn off groups that should remain
in place and leave visible those that should move. Then press the
<TT>Dock</TT> button. The matched points will be positioned so as
to minimize the sum of the squares of their separation (thus the phrase
``least sqaures'').

<P>
If you'd like to dock several of the same object with respect to each
other, remember you can use the copy and paste commands in the hierarchy
editor to create duplicate objects.

1.3 RNA Maps: Finding the phosphates
</H1>

<P>
<I>Authored by Vincent Chen (vbc3@duke.edu)</I>

<P>
This tool (still under development) was designed to aid users in locating
potential phosphate positions in the electron density maps of nucleic
acids. Similar to the existing electron density viewing plug-in, this
tool asks the user to open a map file, and opens a control window
containing many of the same controls as the electron density plug-in.
In addition to these controls, it has a toggle button to activate/deactivate
the &#34;poly picking&#34; feature and a color selection
list. When active, if the user left-clicks on a point in the kinemage,
the polyhedron containing that point will be highlighted in the color
selected. Next, the tool searches through the map to find the highest
electron density value within that selected polyhedron, and places
a marker point on that spot, showing an approximate position for the
phosphorous.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00231000000000000000">
1.3.1 Current Issues</A>
</H2>

<P>
This tool does not differentiate between a point in the electron density
and a point on the actual structure. Clicking on the structure with
the poly picking tool active can result in the program searching through
the whole structure, which can take a very long time. Be sure to click
carefully, and to limit the polyhedra to be selected to a reasonable
size (i.e. have the sigma level set high enough that the polyhedra
are about the size of a phosphate). Also, once the first polyhedron
has been selected, moving the electron density around and selecting
a polyhedron may result in an error. If this happens, the program
will have to be restarted in order to selected a polyhedron not in
the inital set.

1.4 90 Degree Rotations: Seeing precisely
</H1>

<P>
The 90 Degree Rotations plugin provides a simple way to turn your
model by 90 degrees around any of the three Cartesian axes. It also
provides a shortcut back to the standard kinemage orientation: looking
straight down the Z axis from the positive end toward the negative
one, with positive X to the right and positive Y at the top of the
screen.

<P>
This plugin is particularly useful in combination with a trick for
setting up simultaneous orthogonal views of a kinemage. Read about
it in the section on stereo graphics in the KiNG manual.

1.5 ``Lathe'' tool: Just for fun
</H1>

<P>
This is a fun helper that shows what a wide variety of shapes and
forms can be constructed from a clever combination of kinemage primitives.

<P>
The lathe tool takes a single polyline and sweeps it out around an
axis to create a polygonal object. One strip of 64 triangles is created
for every line segment. This tool is ideal for creating anything with
an axis of symmetry: bottles, vases, lamps, simple cylinders, and
so on. The standard axis of rotation is the Y-axis, with rotation
centered at the origin, so keep this in mind when drawing a half-profile
to use with this tool.

<P>

<H1><A NAME="SECTION00300000000000000000">
2. Exporting kinemages in other formats</A>
</H1>

<P>
Several facilities are provided that can help get data out of kinemage
format and into other forms, either for making figures for publication
or for further processing. Due to security restrictions placed on
applets, the export features are unavailable when KiNG is running
in a web browser.

<P>

2.1 Exporting for POV-Ray
</H1>

<P>
KiNG can produce output script files to be fed into the high-quality
free raytracing program POV-Ray (www.povray.org). POV-Ray can generate
all kinds of ``photo-realistic'' effects including different materials
and lighting schemes, simulated depth of field, <I>etc.</I> It is
also very useful for producing digital movies that may be more convenient
to use during talks and presentations. (I recommend the inexpensive
QuickTime Pro from Apple for stitching together all the output images
into a movie.) The POV file is largely complete as written and includes
terse hints for rendering, but if you use this feature much you'll
probably want to learn something about POV-Ray and tweak the scripts
before rendering them. Most of the things you'll want to change are
either at the very top (colors, textures, and sizes of things) or
at the very bottom (camera viewpoint, depth cueing, lighting).

<BR>
2.2 Deprecated export formats
</H1>

<P>
<I>These feature now lag far behind the rest of the program in
functionality; they may not work at all. For this reason, they do
not appear in the menus by default and must be ``enabled'' under
the Tools menu. If you need any of these capabilities, you are encouraged
to contact the author and encourage on-going development.</I>

<P>
You can export kinemages in XML format using the Kinetic Image Markup
Language by choosing <TT>Kin-XML</TT> from the <TT>File | Export</TT>
menu. We recommend giving these files the extension <TT>.xkn</TT>
or <TT>.xml</TT>. At this time, KiNG does not read these files, nor
do other kinemage viewers. Also, they may not include all of the information
that would be present in a traditional kinemage file. However, for
people who would like to operate on the data from a kinemage without
having to write a parser for the kinemage format, we expect this will
be useful and convenient. Translation from the modified XML back to
kinemage format is left as an exercise to the reader ;)

<P>
KiNG also has rudimentary abilities to export its 3-D primitives in
VRML97 (a.k.a. VRML 2.0) format. At present, only dots and balls are
exported, and they are both rendered as spheres. This feature was
intended to facilitate the creation of models for rapid prototyping
systems. As with XML export, contact the author if further development
of this feature would be useful to you.
