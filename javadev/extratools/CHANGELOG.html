==============================================================================
===  TO DO  ==================================================================
==============================================================================
    Build wireframe version of Lathe tool
    
VBC things to do:
  Check ColorGrouperPlugin.populateColorLists to see if there is a way to copy flags 
    from one Klist to another.
  Check GeometryPlugin.doAll to make sure it still opens files correctly.
  Fix PlottingTool so it doesn't use old setDrawnXYZ KPoint functions. (Fixed, but changes
    coordinates of the points now).
  Check functionality in AutoBondRotTool; not sure if auto-updating of point parents
    messes anything up.
  FastaTool rewrite?
  LoopTool rewrite? (delete from file doesn't work)
  RNALineTracker desperately needs a rewrite.

==============================================================================
