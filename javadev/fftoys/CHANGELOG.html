### 0.83 ###
### 0.83 ###
- added adjustable pencil size for drawing in realspace

### 0.82 ###
- improved image loading code in DataManager using a Java TechTip

### 0.81 ###
- moved Patterson function to real space side
- added function to construct repeating lattice from unit cell
- tried doing intensities for recip space display, rather than Fs.
  It's more "correct" but because of the wider range, detail is lost.
  I prefer mapping the Fs directly to brightness for learning purposes.
- made image replication higher-quality for lattice construction
- allow applet to load images from PARAMs named img, img0, img1, img2, etc.

### 0.01 ###
- wrote 3 generations of applet using FFT
