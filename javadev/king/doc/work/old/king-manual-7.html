<P>KiNG runs both as a stand-alone application, and as an applet
that can be included in web pages. In any case, KiNG requires a Java
Virtual Machine (JVM), version 1.3 or higher. You can get Java from
<A HREF="http://java.sun.com">http://java.sun.com</A>.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss7.1">7.1</A> <A HREF="king-manual.html#toc7.1">Running KiNG as an application</A>
</H2>

<P>How you launch the KiNG application will depend on what operating
system (Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, <EM>etc</EM>.) you're using. With Windows
and the Mac, you can usually just double-click on the <CODE>king.jar</CODE> file
to start KiNG. For Linux, there is a shell script called <CODE>king</CODE> that
will launch the program; put it on your path and then edit it to
enter the full path to <CODE>king.jar</CODE>.</P>

<P>On all operating systems, you can type</P>

<P>
<PRE>
java -jar king.jar [-merge | -single] [file1 file2 ...]
</PRE>
</P>
<P>All the files listed on the command line will be merged together
into one kinemage,, unless the <CODE>-s</CODE> flag is included, in which case
all the files will be opened as separate kinemages.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss7.2">7.2</A> <A HREF="king-manual.html#toc7.2">Making KiNG an applet in a web page</A>
</H2>

<P>KiNG can also be included as a web page applet. The following
HTML code is a simple example that uses the &lt;APPLET&gt; tag, which
will work with browsers using a recent JVM. Older browsers may need
&lt;OBJECT&gt; or &lt;EMBED&gt; tags; more information on this is
available from Sun.</P>

<P>
<PRE>
&lt;applet code="king/Kinglet.class" archive="king.jar" width=300 height=150&gt;
&lt;param name="kinSource" value="some_file_name.kin"&gt;
&lt;/applet&gt;
</PRE>
</P>
<P>Just put all the jar files, including king.jar, in the same directory
as the HTML file. Users who visit the page will see a 300x150 KiNG
logo in the web page, along with a floating KiNG window that looks
very much like the stand-alone application. However, due to security
restrictions imposed by the browser environment, some functions (<EM>e.g.</EM>,
saving files) will be disabled.</P>

<P>Some Tools and Plugins may define their own &lt;PARAM&gt; tags,
which will be described in their documentation.</P>
