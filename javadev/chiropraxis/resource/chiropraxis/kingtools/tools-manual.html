1.1 C-alpha Hinges: Protein chiropraxis
</H1>

<P>
The Hinges tool is used to adjust segments of protein backbone without
disturbing the surrounding structure. It allows you to select a region
of backbone that joins two alpha carbons, and then rotate that segment
of backbone around an axis drawn between those C-alphas. Using Hinges
requires that <TT>chiropraxis.jar</TT> be present in the <TT>plugins/</TT>
folder.

<P>
Create a hinge by control-clicking the alpha carbons that act as its
endpoints or anchors. To use the dial control, click and drag the
pointer to the desired value. For finer control you can shift-drag
along an imaginary slider (this behavior is somewhat like the virtual
dials in O). To reset the dial to its starting value, double click
the dial face. The dial can also be adjusted from the graphics window
using the mouse wheel or arrow keys; see below.

<P>
The Hinges panel provides feedback on the geometric quality of the
current model, displaying residues names, deviation of the tau angle
(N-CA-C) from ideality, and the position of the residue on the Ramachandran
plot (phi, psi, and favored/allowed/outlier). Deviant geometry is
highlighted in red.

<P>
The ``Karplus'' field is an alternative measure of deviation in
the tau angle, based on data in P. A. Karplus' 1996 ``Hidden Strain''
paper (Protein Science 5:1406). There he calls the angle tau3, and
claims that its average value varies substantially depending on the
value of backbone angles phi and psi. The meaning and usefulness of
a deviation from this number is still under investigation.

1.2 Sidechain Rotator: Refitting protein models
</H1>

<P>
The Sidchain Rotation tool is useful for doing interactive refitting
of protein models in conjunction with the Hinges tool and the model
manager. Use Ctrl+Click (a.k.a. middle-click) to select a sidechain
to rotate, then pick from a list of predefined rotamers or set the
angles by hand using the dials. The rotamericity of the current sidechain
is monitored in the bottom right corner; it indicates how frequently
(if ever!) the current conformation is found in well-determined structures.

<P>
To use the dial control, click and drag the pointer to the desired
value. For finer control you can shift-drag along an imaginary slider
(this behavior is somewhat like the virtual dials in O). To reset
the dial to its starting value, double click the dial face.

<P>
Sidechain Rotator and the Hinges tool play well together: you can
use both on the same residue(s) at the same time. It's often easiest
to establish which sidechains will be rotatable before beginning to
move the backbone, but it's possible to establish the moving parts
in any order.

1.3 Sidechain Mutator: Redesigning protein models
</H1>

<P>
The Sidchain Mutation tool is useful for doing interactive refitting
of protein models in conjunction with the Hinges and Rotator tools
and the model manager. Use Ctrl+Click (a.k.a. middle-click) to select
a sidechain to mutate, then pick from a list of known amino acid types.
If you select histidine, you will also be prompted to choose a protonation
state.

<P>
Sidechain Mutator plays well with the other tools, but you cannot
mutate the model while any part of it is mobile (``molten'').
Thus, it's often easiest to make mutations first, and then refit the
new sequence.

1.4 Model Manager: Editing a macromolecular model
</H1>

<P>
This facility is for doing molecular modeling based on some starting
model, usually a PDB file. The Model Manager handles opening and saving
these files, and is required for the operation of the following tools:

<P>

<UL>
<LI>C-alpha hinges
</LI>
<LI>Sidechain rotator
</LI>
<LI>Sidechain mutator
</LI>
</UL>
The model manager also tracks the changes made to the model and allows
near-unlimited undo. In addition, it provides access to dynamic visualizations,
like Probe dots and NOE constraints. Using this feature requires that
your OS can find Probe - <I>i.e.</I>, that either Probe resides in
the same directory as <TT>king.jar</TT> and is named either <TT>probe</TT>
or <TT>probe.exe</TT>; or that Probe is somewhere on your PATH and
is named <TT>probe</TT> or <TT>probe.exe</TT>. The same is true of
<TT>noe-display</TT>.

<P>
There are several special symbols that can be inserted into the Probe
and NOE command lines. Their meanings are as follows:

<P>
<DL>
<DT><STRONG>{pdbfile}</STRONG></DT>
<DD>The fully-qualified name of the ``base'' PDB file;
<I>i.e.</I> the one with all changes except the currently molten ones.
(Those are piped in via standard input.)
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>{molten}</STRONG></DT>
<DD>The list of molten residues, separated by commas: 1,
2, 3, ...
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>{center}</STRONG></DT>
<DD>The coordinates of the current center of view, in real
space: x, y, z. This can be used for the <TT>within</TT> <I>distance</I>
<TT>of</TT> <I>x, y, z</I> selection statement. Note that visualizations
aren't automatically updated when the center of view changes.
</DD>
