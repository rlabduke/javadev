### 0.40 ###

### 0.39 ###
- added translucent balls to the output of SequenceSpacer
- found missing-comma bug in BLOSUM code of SequenceSpacer
- added a scaling factor to the BLOSUM code so ball radii come out right
- wrote minimize.SequenceTree to do another analysis of Dezymer sequences
- added "Fast model open" to ModelManager. Some layout issues still remain.
- created some pieces of a MM force field in chiropraxis.forcefield
- stupid bug in AngleTerm was assigning to gradient instead of adding to it
- fixed a bug in Brent's method of GradientMinimizer (wrong endpoint b)
- fixed confusion between search path and gradient in GradientMinimizer
- changed (now correct) Fletcher-Reeves algorithm to Polak-Ribiere; works better
- added RubberBand tool for KiNG
- implemented both simple (all-against-all) and fancy (hash table / 3-D bins)
  approaches to neighbor detection for nonbonded terms. Fancy is preferrable.
- made some changes to line-min in GradMin to keep things from getting stuck
- made separate categories with separate weightings for energy terms in StateMan
  The weightings do make gradient calculation somewhat less efficient, so we may
  want to remove them later if there's no real benefit or use.
- added some GUI controls to the rubber band tool to make it more fun

### 0.38 ###
- wrote AnisoOxygenSearch
- modified build.xml to include all of driftwood including Jama

### 0.37 ###
- created a LyX document for the tools
- updated ModellingTool to use help URL from this JAR
- recompiled kingtools b/c BasicTool.overpaintCanvas() changed signature

### 0.36 ###
- moved all the KiNG remodelling tools into the kingtools package

### 0.35 ###
- added SidechainAngles2.getAllRotamers(String)
- added sc.RotamersForTerwilliger to produce rotamer files from Penultimate Lib.

### 0.34 ###
- SidechainAngles.setAllAngles() now ignores the NaN's that can be produced
  by measureAllAngles().
- SidechainIdealizer.idealizeSidechain() now uses all angles instead of chis.
  Hopefully, this will remove some of the remaining bugs (e.g. for prolines)
- fixing the proline idealization bug also required redefining pchi3 using 1HD.

### 0.33 ###
- started H-bond network analysis in beta sheet
- allowed peptides to be incomplete
- connected up peptides into beta-sheet network
- calculated planes, sheet normals, and local coordinate systems
- added visualization of planes in addition to their normal vectors
- added parallel/antiparallel flags to Peptide
- fixed build.xml to clean up itext.jar and jama.jar
- added "deploy-local-mp" target to deploy to MolProbity3
- Ramalyze now reads PDB filename from cmd line params
- moved LsqPlane to driftwood and removed explicit Jama dependency
- added mc.AltConfBackrubFinder to speed the search for alt-conf examples
- fixed SidechainIdealizer.idealizeSidechain() so it doesn't leave
  Ala's hydrogens oriented randomly.
- migrated to using version.props AND buildnum.props to simplify version control

### 0.32 ###
- started working on RamaPdfWriter to test out how we could create multi-page
  PDF Ramachandran plots for multiple-model NMR structures.
- added rotarama.Ramalyze and hooked it up to RamaPdfWriter
- changed mc.CaRotation to idealize whole sidechains instead of just C-betas.
- added jama.jar to the build process
- gave Rama plots more sensible residues names (chain, seg ID only if needed)
- PDF writer now collects and reuses templates for each model
- missing hashCode() in Ramalyze.RamaEval led to duplications with alt confs
- added summary statistics and outlier list for all models and model-by-model
- stats are now 1 column or 2
- model numbers appear in residue labels
- model number and file name are now printed on each page
- basic command line switches and help information added to Ramalyze
- added itext.jar and jama.jar to the Manifest
  
### 0.31 ###
- made CB idealization optional for CaRotation.makeConformation()
- did the same for CaRotation.twistPeptides()

### 0.30 ###
- fixed typo for Trp m95 rotamer (+/- problem)

### 0.29 ###
- changed build.xml so the default target is "dist"

### 0.28 ###
- modified sc.SidechainAngles2 to use driftwood.data instead of driftwood.gnutil
- fixed MSE SE naming incompatibility between angle-naming code and ideal geom residues
- fixed bug in sc.SidechainAngles2.areParentAndChild()
  It was recognized that MSE SE did not have a remoteness indicator, BUT
  there was a logical error in the code because it had never been tested.

### 0.27 ###
- created TauByPhiPsi to evaluate tau by Ramachandran position,
  using initial data from P. A. Karplus' 1996 "Hidden Strain" paper.
- added facilities for constructing mutations into SidechainIdealizer
  
### 0.26 ###
- Changes to Ramachandran, CaRotation, and Suppose
  to accomodate changes in driftwood.moldb2 ver. 0.48
- RotamerSampler can now create copies of the template residue and re-index them.
  A small benefit here, but it lays the foundation for mutations, etc. in KiNG.
- bug fix: removed the mysterious N-epsilon from definitions of Pro rotamers
- added a chi-angles/all-angles distinction to RotamerSampler
- changed the scheme for weights in Q to make best use of the space available
- bug-fix: using all angles read the weight from the wrong field

### 0.25 ###
- added NdftToPgm for converting NDFTs to Portable Gray Map files.
  Can use the UNIX utility 'pnmtopng' to get a PNG file from this.
- fixed NDFloatTable bug that zeros out realcount when reading from a NDFT file.
- created sc.RotamerSampler for generating PDB models of sampled conformers

### 0.24 ###
- added sequence-distance scoring based on the BLOSUM 62 matrix (-blosum)
- added mc.HingeFit, which searches for a series of Backrub-like hinges
  that reduce RMSD between two related loops.
- I was frustrated that I couldn't seem to find the minimum
  around the axis of rotation in an analytic way.
- made sc.SidechainAngles2.measure{All,Chi}Angles() return Double.NaN
  for ill-defined angles instead of throwing AtomException.

### 0.23 ###
- started minimize package to do Cartesian-space minimizations
- built a simple harmonic potential to put "springs" between points
- built a steepest-descent minimizer with arbitrary step length
- optimizations (caching) in the potential function gave better than 2x speed improvement.
  This is good for dense networks (force b/t every pair) but not for sparse.
- built a dual-purpose steepest-descent/conjugate gradient minimizer.
  It still takes arbitrary steps though, so there's less advantage from CG.
- improved the visualization kinemage
- added line-search option to find true minimum along each gradient/search path
- renamed to GradientMinimizer
- added code to check for numerical instabilities (NaN)
- determined that box size for initial placement has no effect on outcome
=== MAJOR REORGANIZATION OF PACKAGE STRUCTURES ===
- removed the backrub package! (no longer used by anything...)
- removed the failed 'nmr' package; not needed since Coggins' noe-display
- merged the cairo package into the mc package

### 0.22 ###
- fixed typos in defining Met/Sme rotamers ttt and mmt

### 0.21 ###
- added idealizeSidechain() to SidechainIdealizer.
- fixed a problem in CaRotation.transformAtoms() where an AtomException
  could cause the transform to fail for all atoms.

### 0.20 ###
- modified rotarama.Rotamer to also work with moldb2

### 0.19 ###
- converted SidechainAngles to SidechainAngles2 (moldb to moldb2)

### 0.18 ###
- made Lesk sieve into a sorting procedure
- dropped correlation/dot product kinemages
- renamed VectorDiffDist to Suppose
- wrote help file for Suppose
- added switches to select size of superpositioned subset
- calculated RMSDs in-line and added IWUSDD to Lesk plot for comparison

### 0.17 ###
- wrote VectorDiffDist
- discovered iteration (using prev values as weights) improves signal-to-noise
- unsigned sum of diff dists seems to work better than vectors (but no 3-D info)
- I think all the vectors get biased towards the center-of-mass of the structure.
  So far, plots of dot products haven't been helpful in confirming this.
- implemented Lesk's least-squares "sieving" procedure using driftwood.r3.SuperPoser
- added Lesk plot to VectorDiffDist

### 0.16 ###
- Fixed a bug in CaRotation.twistPeptides() that only kept the last twist
- Checked SidechainIdealizer for the same bug; it's clean

### 0.15 ###
- added nmr package with NoeConstraints and DyanaReader
- started trying to test it out, but the names are all screwed up!

### 0.14 ###
- added ability to rotate lots of peptides to CaRotation

### 0.13 ###
- removed artificial ceiling on residue separation in CaRotation

### 0.12 ###
- migrates Cairo over to using MolDB2
- created sc.SidechainIdealizer to idealize C-betas in MolDB2
- made Cairo fix the C-betas
- changed sc.SidechainAngle to use GnuLinkedHashMap/Set classes

### 0.11 ###
- updated Rotamer and angles.props to treat MSE (seleno-Met)
- sc.SidechainAngles.areParentAndChild() would fail on MSE b/c SE
  has no remoteness indicator; workaround added.
  Not tested yet b/c Reduce doesn't add all the appropriate H.
- created package 'cairo' to handle Ca-Ca rotations
- wrote (first draft of) CaRotation for use by KiNG

### 0.10 ###
- made Ramachandran follow the Singleton pattern (with optional workaround)
  to conserve memory without requiring explicit caching by the programmer.
- added means to assess rotamer quality (rotarama.Rotamer)

### 0.09 ###
- created sc.RotamerDef to simplify rotamer management
- added frequency data to angles.props

### 0.08 ###
- renamed packages
- added sc.SidechainAngles for dealing with rotatable sidechains,
  and for measuring chi angles for future rotamer analysis.
- finished describing all DoF for each side chain
- started listing canonical rotamers from Lovell et al.
- finished listing all rotamers

### 0.07 ###
- changed Backrub to optimize conformations based on RMSD(tau) rather than
  worst tau. Using the worst causes insensitivity to the other taus, leading
  to random (and usually worse) conformations there!

### 0.06 ###
- major rotation now also swings side chain of central atom (Backrub)
- IdealSidechain now corrects the whole sidechain position when idealizing the C-beta
- made Backrub update ("liken") sidechain atoms too

### 0.05 ###
- added rama.Ramachandran and rama.NDFloatTable
  I think this is better than trying to build a general-purpose Ramachandran
  library function, at least for the moment.
- rewrote NDFloatTable.valueAt() to eliminate extra memory allocations

### 0.04 ###
- created IdealSidechain. This may belong in a different top-level package,
  but better to move it later on...
- made some changes to the API of Backrub

### 0.03 ###
- started in on the real Backrub class that will be used in production
- wrote peptide-orientation optimizing routines for Backrub
- modified TryTrio to use Backrub, got nice improvements in tau (!)

### 0.02 ###
- created backrub.TryTrio as proof of concept

### 0.01 ###
- started with chiropraxis.backrub.* to do simple two-peptide motion
  using three degrees of freedom in the azimuthal C-alpha trace
