==============================================================================
===  TO DO  ==================================================================
==============================================================================
    I think we could eliminate x2/y2/z2 to save memory (ditto for x0/y0/z0, by reloading)
        need 2's for line depth sort/drawing; reload is how slow?
    Alternative input without stylus? (Canvas.hasPointerMotionEvents())
    Add polyline breaker to separate really long lines into chunks
    Support views?
    Move to block architecture or file format version numbers? Use real kin fmt?
    Move clipping into the View class
  * Support animations (via groups, or not?)
 ** Fire button toggles input mode (2 or 4, dep. on pointer events or not)
    Add basic help text
    Document binary format
    Redo colors with good rounding

===  CHANGE LOG  =============================================================
==============================================================================

### 1.05 ###
- implemented thick lines
- changed manual double buffering to check for automatic dbl buf first
- changed "Hide" to "Show" rhetoric; sync show/hide list with view state
- made clipping steps coarser
- moved KingLite/Hai-KiNG into Java Subversion repository

### 1.04 ###
- back buffer now notices screen size changes and adjusts
- old kin is discarded to free memory before new one is loaded
- kins can be loaded from URLs
- kins from URLs are stored locally
- loads can be done from multiple blocks to limit memory needed for buffers
- now allow user to hide points by type (lines/dots/labels/balls)

### 1.03 ###
- load all from PalmDataBase / RecordStore
- added double buffering (optional) to drawing engine
- allow deletion of RecordStores

### 1.02 ###
- experimented with loading from RecordStores and Palm DataBases

### 1.01 ###
- fixed flatland bug (include cz, shift-shift loss of precision)
- fixed (most) wild lines created by zooming in on polylines

### 1.00 ###
- created KingMain, KinCanvas, KPoint, and View
- basic rotation, zoom, clip of vectors and dots works
- added pickcenter function
- scale func now eliminates pts/vectors that won't be drawn in ANY orientation
- added loader for binary kinemage files
- created binary kin export for KiNG
- added new graphics types: thick lines and dots, balls, and labels
- moved pointIDs to a hashtable so must points don't allocate space for them
- added flatland translation
- added perspective rendering
