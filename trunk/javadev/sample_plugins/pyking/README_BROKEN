Once upon a time, this actually worked.

Now, however, it doesn't.  Although the Python file PyKingConsole.py gets
"compiled" to a real Java class, that class extends Object rather than
king.Plugin.  I'm not sure why this ever worked at all, but now it certainly
does NOT, in part because KiNG can't call the static method isAppletSafe() on
the PyKingConsole class.
