<h1>The KingLite binary file format</h1>
<h3>Definitions</h3>
All data is read/stored according to the conventions of the
java.io.DataInput/Output interfaces, namely:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Multi-byte values are writen high byte first, low byte last
(i.e., big endian)</li>
  <li>Bytes are one byte (eight bits), unsigned. They are usually ASCII
characters.</li>
  <li>Chars are two bytes, unsigned. They are Unicode characters.</li>
  <li>Ints are four bytes, signed. The high bit is the sign bit.</li>
</ul>
<h3>General format overview</h3>
The format consists of a linear series of data blocks, terminated by
end-of-file. Each data block is at least four bytes (read as one int).<br>
<br>
If the high bit of that int is clear (0), the entry is a point. That
int is the "multi" entry for the point, and is followed by three more
ints for the x, y, and z coordinates of the point. Points that are
indicated to have a point ID are then followed by an int giving the
length of the point ID as a Unicode string, and then the string itself
(note that the length is the number of chars; that is, twice the number
of bytes). Otherwise, all point entries are exactly 16 bytes (multi +
x, y, z). For more details on the meaning of bit fields within multi,
see the KPoint code.<br>
<br>
If the high bit of the int is set (1), the entry is an "entity" -- any
other type of data that might be found in a kinemage file. The upper 16
bits, except the sign bit (bits 16-30, but not bit 31) indicate what
type of entity this is. The lower 16 bits (bits 0-15) as an unsigned
short integer give the number of remaining bytes consumed by this
entity data block. The total length of the block is thus 4 bytes for
the intial int plus zero or more additional bytes, as indicated by this
field. In this way, programs can skip block types they don't understand
when reading newer files. <br>
<h3>General format vs. Palm DataBase (PDB) format</h3>
Palm OS uses a special binary format for storing its data, which is
(partially) documented at <a
 href="http://www.palmos.com/dev/support/docs/fileformats/Intro.html">http://www.palmos.com/dev/support/docs/fileformats/Intro.html</a>.
When the file contents conform to both that format and the expectations
of the IBM "J9" Java Virtual Machine, the data can be accessed via the
javax.microedition.rms API.<br>
<br>
The first record will be the human-readable name of the kinemage. (As
distinguished from the name of the record store, which contains a
timestamp to help ensure uniqueness.) The second record has a poorly
defined purpose at the present time, but might indicate the origin or
copyright for the kinemage. The third and any subsequent records
contain the binary kinemage format data as described in the rest of
this document. Multiple data records are allowed to aid in conserving
memory while the kinemage is loaded. They may be of any length, and
when concatenated in order they should be indentical to the kinemage
data if it were stored as a single record.<br>
<h3>Entity definitions</h3>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: monospace;">ENT_GROUP,
ENT_SUBGROUP, ENT_LIST</span>:
A kinemage group, subgroup, or list. Its data consists of an
integer (bitflags for various attributes), and then the length of its
name (int, measured in chars) and the Unicode characters
for its name. Note that the length of this string could also be derived
from
the total length of the data block.<br>
