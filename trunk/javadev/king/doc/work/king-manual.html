<h2> Abstract</h2>
 K<font size="-2">I</font>NG (Kinemage, Next Generation) is an interactive system for
three-dimensional vector graphics. It supports a set of graphics primitives
that make it suitable for many types of graphs, plots, and other illustrations;
although its first use was to display macromolecular structures for
biophysical research.  K<font size="-2">I</font>NG builds on  M<font size="-2">AGE</font>,  J<font size="-2">AVA</font>M<font size="-2">AGE</font>,
and the "kinemage" (kinetic image) concept to deliver a full-featured
Java application with a user-friendly interface and integrated editing
features. It also operates as a Java applet to promote easy access
to kinemages from a web browser.

Chapter 1 </a><br />Getting started</h1>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 <h2><a name="tth_sEc1.1">
1.1</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;What is a kinemage?</h2>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
A kinemage is a "kinetic image," an interactive, three-dimensional
illustration. Because kinemages contain simple geometric objects -
points, lines, spheres, <em>etc.</em> - they are suited to a great
variety of subjects, from simple sketches to sophisticated plots to
detailed schematics of 3-D objects. Their strength is in <em>selective</em>
presentation of information - they were originally intended as an
alternative to flat, static illustrations in scientific journals.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
In fact, kinemages were first created as a way of visualizing macromolecular
structures, particularly x-ray crystal structures of proteins. However,
such a kinemage is a <em>drawing</em> of a molecule, albeit a 3-D drawing,
and not the molecule itself. Thus, the kinemage lacks most of the
information in a PDB file, and kinemage display program cannot read
PDB files directly. Since their creation, kinemages have been extended
to a variety of other fields, from the social sciences to ecology
to education.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The kinemage concept is the brainchild of Drs. David and Jane Richardson
at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina, USA. Their website is
at <a href="http://kinemage.biochem.duke.edu"><tt>http://kinemage.biochem.duke.edu</tt></a>.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 <h2><a name="tth_sEc1.2">
1.2</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Starting the KiNG program</h2>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
If you're reading this, you may already have KiNG running. In that
case, feel free to skip this section. If not, we'll guide you through
getting KiNG up and running on your system.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
     <h3><a name="tth_sEc1.2.1">
1.2.1</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Download KiNG</h3>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
If you don't already have a copy of KiNG, you can download it from
<a href="http://kinemage.biochem.duke.edu"><tt>http://kinemage.biochem.duke.edu</tt></a>. Even if you have a copy already,
you might check periodically for new version that add features and
fix bugs. If you run on a Windows or Linux machine and aren't already
knowledgeable about Java techonology, we recommend downloading the
package that includes a Java Virtual Machine in the bundle. (This
isn't an issue for Macintosh owners.)

<div class="p"><!----></div>
If you just want to run KiNG as an applet on MolProbity or some other
web page, you can skip this step. You can always download a copy later
if you want to run it off-line.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
     <h3><a name="tth_sEc1.2.2">
1.2.2</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Make sure you have Java</h3>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
KiNG is written in the Java programming language, and so requires
that the Java libraries (version 1.5 or later) be present on your
computer in order for it to run. Newer Apple computers (those running
Mac OS X) come with Java. Most PCs do not, though recently several
manufacturers have agreed to pre-install Java on their new computers.
Look for the coffee-cup icon in your Windows task bar or in the Control
Panel.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
If you don't have Java, you may have downloaded a copy of KiNG that
was bundled with its own installation of Java. If you ran the InstallAnywhere
installation program, this is the copy you have; don't worry about
downloading and installing another copy of Java.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
If you don't have Java and you didn't download the bundled version
of KiNG, point your web browser to <a href="http://java.sun.com/getjava/index.html"><tt>http://java.sun.com/getjava/index.html</tt></a>.
The software is free and available for Windows, Linux, and Solaris
computers. We recommend getting the newest version that is available
(1.6.0 as of this writing).

<div class="p"><!----></div>
     <h3><a name="tth_sEc1.2.3">
1.2.3</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Launch KiNG</h3>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Launching KiNG is as simple as double clicking on the "KiNG"
icon. If you didn't download a package with an installer, <em>etc.</em>
you may need to click on <tt>king.jar</tt> instead.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
For Unix types who want a shell script, we recommend something like
this:

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<dl compact="compact">
 <dt><b></b></dt>
	<dd>
#!/bin/sh

<div class="p"><!----></div>
exec&nbsp;java&nbsp;-Xms32m&nbsp;-Xmx512m&nbsp;-jar&nbsp;/home/ian/bin/jars/king.jar&nbsp;$@
</dd>
</dl>
The <tt>-Xms</tt> and <tt>-Xmx</tt> switches control the amount of
memory initially allocated to the Java program and the maximum memory
it can consume. The default maximum of 64 MB should be enough for
almost any kinemage, but a few of the largest require more (hence
the <tt>-Xmx512m</tt> recommendation). 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
If you just want to run KiNG as an applet from a web page, you can
just visit that web page now. If you don't see the "Kinglet"
logo after a minute or two, make sure your browser is properly configured
to work with Java. How you do this depends on which browser you have;
consult its documentation for details.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 <h2><a name="tth_sEc1.3">
1.3</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Opening a kinemage</h2>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
If you already have a kinemage you want to look at, this step is simple:
just choose <tt>Open</tt> from the <tt>File</tt> menu, and select
the kinemage you'd like to view. If you don't have anything to look
at right now, don't worry! Choose <tt>Help  -  Built-in kinemages</tt>,
and select one of the provided files to explore. See 
for more places to get kinemages from.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 <h2><a name="tth_sEc1.4">
1.4</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Basic kinemage reading: Using KiNG to view a kinemage</h2>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
     <h3><a name="tth_sEc1.4.1">
1.4.1</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Basic interaction<a name="basic-interaction">
</a></h3>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
      <h4><a name="tth_sEc1.4.1.1">
1.4.1.1</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving the kinemage around</h4>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
A kinemage is a dynamic, 3-D illustration. The best way to take advantage
of that is by rotating it and twisting it around. Just click the mouse
near the center of the graphics window and slowly drag right or left,
up or down. If you have multiple buttons on your mouse, use the left
button or button 1. You can also use the left and right arrow keys
for small rotations. If you get lost or disoriented, use the <tt>Views</tt>
menu to get back on familiar ground.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
      <h4><a name="tth_sEc1.4.1.2">
1.4.1.2</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Identifying points</h4>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
By clicking on points with the mouse (left button again), you'll be
able to identify them. The label associated with each point will appear
in the bottom right of the graphics area. Furthermore, the distance
from this point to the last one you clicked will also be displayed.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
      <h4><a name="tth_sEc1.4.1.3">
1.4.1.3</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Markers</h4>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
For keeping track of which point is selected, markers can be displayed.
Two markers are displayed normally. The checkbox for markers is just
below the graphics area, with the pickcenter checkbox.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
      <h4><a name="tth_sEc1.4.1.4">
1.4.1.4</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning groups on &amp; off</h4>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Most kinemages have many different components to them, grouped together
in logical ways. A protein might have one group for each subunit;
or one group for mainchain, another for side chains, and yet another
for hydrogens. Groups and subgroups are given names and can be made
visible or hidden by the viewer - you might want to see only one
subunit, or only the backbone (without sidechains and hydrogens cluttering
up the view).

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The groups and subgroups appear in the button pane, to the right of
the graphics area. Each one has a button to turn it on or off. Groups
that are on (visible) usually have a check mark or an X in there box;
a blank button means the group is hidden. Many kinemages start off
with some information hidden, to avoid overwhelming the reader. Always
check to see if there's more information available than is being displayed!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
      <h4><a name="tth_sEc1.4.1.5">
1.4.1.5</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Re-centering</h4>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
You can make any point in the kinemage be the center. The center point
will be in the middle of the graphics area, and the kinemage will
rotate about that point. There are several ways to set the center:
you can hold the Shift key while you click the point, or use the right
mouse button if you have one. You can also press the <tt>Pick
center</tt> button below the graphics area and then click on the desired
point.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Since re-centering brings a point to the center of the screen, using
this repeatedly allows one to "walk" through a large structure.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
      <h4><a name="tth_sEc1.4.1.6">
1.4.1.6</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Zooming in and out</h4>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
KiNG allows you to zoom in to see small details in a kinemage. Use
the <tt>Zoom</tt> slider, below the graphics area, to control how
far you zoom in. You can click the mouse right or left of the knob
for small movements or click the knob and drag it for larger ones.
A small motion is usually all that's needed.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
For easier access, one can hold Shift and drag (or drag using the
right mouse button) in the graphics window. Dragging down zooms in;
up zooms out. The up/down arrow keys and mouse wheel (Java 1.4 and
later only) also control zooming.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
      <h4><a name="tth_sEc1.4.1.7">
1.4.1.7</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Clipping</h4>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Objects that are too near the viewer, or too far away, are not displayed;
otherwise, zooming in would result in a useless superposition. The
depth of the clipping "slab" can be adjusted using the slider
along the bottom, or by dragging side-to-side with the right mouse
button (or with the Shift key held down).

<div class="p"><!----></div>
      <h4><a name="tth_sEc1.4.1.8">
1.4.1.8</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;More modes of interation</h4>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
For more ways to explore the kinemage and interact with it, be sure
to read about the <tt>Navigate</tt> tool (see ).

<div class="p"><!----></div>
     <h3><a name="tth_sEc1.4.2">
1.4.2</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Reading the kinemage text</h3>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Exploring on your own is great, but the best guide to a kinemage is
its author. Often, he or she includes a short text of a few paragraphs
or pages that explains what the kinemage depicts. You can access this
text using the <tt>Show text</tt> button, located just below the graphics
area. An equivalent command is also available in the <tt>Edit</tt>
menu.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
     <h3><a name="tth_sEc1.4.3">
1.4.3</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Using different viewpoints</h3>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Most kinemages have one or more "views" that were selected by
the author to highlight some significant feature. These views are
accessible from the <tt>Views</tt> menu. Just click on one of the
named views and the kinemage will "jump" to that view. You can
then rotate it, zoom in or out, <em>etc.</em> to explore further. You
can always return to the original view by selecting it again from
the menu.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Kinemages without any predefined views still get an automatic "overview"
view. This is a useful way to return to a known starting point if
you get lost in a complicated structure.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The kinemage format also allows for flip-book style animations, automatic
searching for points based on their name (the label that appears in
the lower left when the point is clicked), and much more. There is
also a rich selection of features to control exactly how the graphics
are rendered. See  to learn more.

 <h2><a name="tth_sEc2.1">
2.1</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Opening a kinemage</h2>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
To open a new kinemage, go the the <tt>File</tt> menu and choose <tt>Open</tt>.
Browse through your file system and find a kinemage file. These files
typically end in .<tt>kin</tt>. The new version-control convention
is to name modified files <tt>.1.kin</tt>, <tt>.2.kin</tt>, <em>etc</em>.,
though older kinemages that have been edited may have revisions named
.<tt>kip</tt>, <tt>kip1</tt>, <tt>kip2</tt>, <em>etc</em>. Click the
button marked OK and KiNG will begin loading the file. You'll see
a progress bar as KiNG loads the contents of the file, and then the
first kinemage in that file will be displayed in the graphics area
(where the logo used to be).

<div class="p"><!----></div>
You can also drag and drop kinemages into the KiNG graphics window
in order to open them, but this feature is not supported for Java
versions prior to 1.4. On Mac OS X machines, you can also double-click
<tt>.kin</tt> files in the Finder or drag kinemage files onto the
KiNG Dock icon to launch KiNG and open the file.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Additionally, files can be specified on the command line, as in <tt>king&nbsp;-s&nbsp;foo.kin&nbsp;bar.kin</tt>,
which will load all the kinemages in those two files upon startup.
The <tt>-s</tt> (or <tt>-single</tt>) flag is required so that KiNG
knows not to merge the two files together.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 <h2><a name="tth_sEc2.2">
2.2</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Working with multiple kinemages</h2>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
If your file has more than one kinemage, you can choose which one
you want to look at from the drop box on the right, just above the
buttons. You can also use <tt>File</tt>  -  <tt>Open</tt> to load additional
files; those kinemages will also appear in the drop box. When you're
done, use <tt>File</tt>  -  <tt>Close</tt> to get rid of the current
kinemage, or use <tt>File</tt>  -  <tt>Close all</tt> to get rid of
all the open kinemages.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
If you save your file when more than one kinemage is open, they will
<em>all</em> be written out to that file, in the order they currently
appear in. This is an easy way to create multi-kinemage files, but
be careful that you don't save <em>more</em> than you intended to!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 <h2><a name="tth_sEc2.3">
2.3</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Appending a kinemage<a name="appending-a-kinemage">
</a></h2>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Sometimes you want to combine the contents of multiple kinemages.
You might want to combine a graph of your latest sales data with some
nicely formated and labeled axes you prepared last month. Or maybe
you want to combine a ribbon drawing of your favorite protein with
a representation of the atomic detail at its active site. In either
case, using <tt>File  -  Append</tt> will combine the contents of a
new file with the contents of the currently displayed kinemage. Be
careful - if the new file contains multiple kinemages, they'll <em>all</em>
be merged into the current one!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
This behavior can be achieved on the command line by specifying multiple
files, as in <tt>king&nbsp;-m&nbsp;foo.kin&nbsp;bar.kip1</tt>, which will merge
all the kinemages in those two files upon startup. The <tt>-m</tt>
(or <tt>-merge</tt>) flag is optional; merging multiple files is the
default behavior.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 <h2><a name="tth_sEc2.4">
2.4</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Saving kinemages</h2>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
You can save kinemages using the <tt>File  -  Save as</tt> menu; these
files are typically given the extension <tt>.kin</tt>. KiNG will try
to help you by automatically appending a number to the filename so
that your changes don't overwrite your original. The resulting kinemage
file will be plain text that you can view and even edit by hand using
any text editor (though of course you don't have to!). If you choose
to do this and want use a word processor (like Microsoft Word), make
sure that you load and save the file in plain text format.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Note that due to the security restrictions that web browsers place
on Java applets, saving will never be possible when KiNG is running
inside a web browser.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 <h2><a name="tth_sEc2.5">
2.5</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Printing kinemages</h2>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
You can use <tt>File  -  Print</tt> to send the image in the graphics
area to your printer. The image will fill as much of the page as possible
without distorting it. The relative size of the elements will be exactly
the same as on screen. Among the consequences of this are that an
image printed from a small graphics window will have thicker lines
when printed than will the image when printed from a larger graphics
window. Don't worry about this too much; just remember printing is
WYSIWYG (what-you-see-is-what-you-get). If it looks right on the screen,
it should look right on the paper! Some images will fit better in
landscape mode than portrait mode; this decision is left up to the
user.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Printing should work even when KiNG is running in a web browser, although
the user will generally be asked for permission first.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 <h2><a name="tth_sEc2.6">
2.6</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Exporting kinemages in other formats</h2>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Several facilities are provided that can help get data out of kinemage
format and into other forms, either for making figures for publication
or for further processing. Due to security restrictions placed on
applets, the export features are unavailable when KiNG is running
in a web browser.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
     <h3><a name="tth_sEc2.6.1">
2.6.1</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Exporting bitmapped images (JPEG, PNG)</h3>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The <tt>File  -  Export</tt> menu allows one to save the current graphics
image as a standard image file. Image export requires that you have
Java 1.4 or newer; otherwise, an error message will appear. Several
image formats are supported, including JPEG and PNG; the format can
be selected from the export dialog box. These images are very useful
for creating web pages, PowerPoint-style presentations, <em>etc</em>.
For high-quality publication graphics, however, you'll want to use
a vector-based format like PDF.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
     <h3><a name="tth_sEc2.6.2">
2.6.2</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Exporting vector graphics (PDF, PostScript, <em>etc.</em>)</h3>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Rather than sending the image to the printer, it can be captured for
inclusion in a publication or later manipulation in a graphics program
like Adobe Illustrator. Note that there are several relevant options
under the <tt>Display</tt> menu, particularly <tt>White background</tt>
and <tt>Monochrome</tt>.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
All platforms can generate PDF files using the <tt>File  -  Export</tt>
menu. This is the simplest and best option for almost any use. "PDF"
stands for Portable Document Format, the successor to PostScript as
the standard for vector graphics. You can learn more about PDFs at
<a href="http://www.adobe.com"><tt>http://www.adobe.com</tt></a>. It does require the (free) iText PDF
library from <a href="http://www.lowagie.com/iText/"><tt>http://www.lowagie.com/iText/</tt></a>, which is distributed
with KiNG.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
If for some reason you don't want to use PDF export, it is also often
possible to hijack the print output into a file. For instance, with
Macintosh OS X, both PostScript and PDF output are supported directly
from the Print dialog. Under Linux, choosing <tt>Print to file</tt>
from the Print dialog will generate a PostScript file, which can be
converted many other formats using <em>e.g.</em> Ghostscript tools like
<tt>ps2pdf</tt> (PDF) and <tt>ps2epsi</tt> (EPS, Encapsulated PostScript).
Under Microsoft Windows, things don't seem to be as straightforward,
but one possiblity is to install the generic PostScript printer drivers
from Adobe and then direct this "virtual printer" to FILE (rather
than, <em>e.g.</em>, LPT1). Your mileage may vary; I'd be interested
in hearing about better ways to do this from any Windows experts out
there.

 <h2><a name="tth_sEc3.1">
3.1</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Finding points by name</h2>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Every point in a kinemage has an associated identifying label, which
appears in the graphics area when the point is clicked on. You can
find one or more points by searching through those labels for a word
or phrase using the <tt>Edit</tt>  -  <tt>Find point</tt> dialog. When
you press <tt>Search</tt>, KiNG will center the view on the first
point that matches your criteria (you may need to zoom in/out to see
it appropriately). <tt>Edit  -  Find next</tt> will then jump to the
next matching point, until all matches are exhausted.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
     <h3><a name="tth_sEc3.1.1">
3.1.1</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Whole word searches</h3>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
This is the easiest-to-use of the search options, and usually produces
the desired results. You can enter one or more words or numbers in
the search field (separated by spaces), and KiNG will find all the
points that contain <em>all</em> of those words, in any order. A search
for "val 17" would find "17 A val cb" but not "valine
117".

<div class="p"><!----></div>
     <h3><a name="tth_sEc3.1.2">
3.1.2</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Substring searches</h3>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
This works like whole word searches, but will even find points that
have the search terms embedded in a larger word or number. In this
case, a search for "val 17" <em>would</em> find "valine 117".
This often produces extraneous results but may occasionally be useful.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
     <h3><a name="tth_sEc3.1.3">
3.1.3</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Glob (simple regex) searches</h3>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
This search is done with a simple "regular expression", as is
often used for specifying file names on the command line. A star (*)
matches any group of zero or more characters, and a question mark
(?) matches any single character. Notice that the search is treated
as a single term, rather than multiple words - the pieces must be
in the correct order. Thus a search for "val*17" would find
"val17", "val 17", and "valine 117", among others;
but would <em>not</em> find "17 val".

<div class="p"><!----></div>
     <h3><a name="tth_sEc3.1.4">
3.1.4</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Perl5 regex searches</h3>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
This search is like the simple regex search but uses the full syntax
of Perl 5 regular expressions, as implemented by the <tt>gnu.regexp</tt>
library. (I'm no expert, but it seems to be a very complete and official
implementation. All but the most esoteric features are available.)
Regular expressions are a very involved subject, and many books and
on-line references are available for the interested reader.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
     <h3><a name="tth_sEc3.1.5">
3.1.5</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Tips for faster searches</h3>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Remember that KiNG searches through <em>all</em> visible points to find
ones matching your criteria. Turning off (<em>i.e.</em>, making invisible,
hiding, unchecking) large groups that you're not interested in will
skip searching those groups. Since all the varieties of search are
implemented internally with regular expressions, they are relatively
computationally expensive. A search through a large kinemage may take
several seconds.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 <h2><a name="tth_sEc3.2">
3.2</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Viewing animations</h2>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Kinemages often include animations. An animation in this sense is
not a movie, but more like a flip-book, where similar images are aligned
and displayed one at a time, in a series of discrete frames. If a
kinemage contains animation(s), there will be forward and reverse
buttons for the animation located below the checkboxes for groups
and masters.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 <h2><a name="tth_sEc3.3">
3.3</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Controlling presentation: The Display menu</h2>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The <tt>Display</tt> menu offers several options for controlling how
the kinemage is rendered. Of particular interest is the <tt>Perspective</tt>
option. By default, KiNG renders objects with orthographic perspective;
objects near the viewer are no larger than those far away. This is
the preferred mode for viewing macromolecular structures and many
2-D graphs and figures. However, for geometrical objects and other
cases where the eye expects perspective, enabling this option will
result in a much more natural-looking image.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
There are also several ways of controlling the coloring of the points.
Each point may have its own color, and several "aspects" as
well. For example, a map might be colored by the aspects of temperature,
elevation, and annual rainfall; one could then choose which of these
colorings to apply.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The first level of grouping above the individual point is the list;
every point belongs to a list. Points that don't have a color specified
take their color from the list, but there are times when one might
want to suppress the individual colors and color points by the color
of the list they belong to. This option is available as well.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
     <h3><a name="tth_sEc3.3.1">
3.3.1</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Stereo<a name="using_stereo">
</a></h3>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Upon request, KiNG will render the kinemage as a stereoscopic pair
of images. The two views are very nearly the same, except that one
is slightly rotated with respect to the other. If you can get one
eye to look at each image, you can fool yourself into seeing additional
depth information. Stereo can be either "cross-eye" or "wall-eye";
the former is somewhat easier to learn, but the later is more comfortable
for long periods of time.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
To see cross-eye stereo, cross your eyes and then look at the screen
without refocusing. You should see 4 identical (though blurry) images.
Relax your eyes slightly, and the center two will overlap. If you
can focus on this phantom central image, you'll be seeing in stereo.
It may help bring the image into sharp focus to rotate the kinemage
slighly using the mouse.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
If you've got KiNG set for wall-eye stereo and your eyes set for cross-eye
(or vice versa), you will see a stereoscopic image, but the parts
that should be in back will be in front, and it will rotate the wrong
direction when you move the mouse. Change one or the other to get
a more reasonable image.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Incidentally, although KiNG doesn't support multiple simultaneous
views of the same kinemage, you can simulate a pair of orthogonal
views by setting the stereo separation to 90 degrees in <tt>Edit
 -  Configure KiNG</tt>. Of course, the views no longer forms a stero image,
but they're useful in another way. Particularly applicable for "info-vis"
kinemages, you can examine (for instance) the x-y plane and the y-z
plane at the same time using this trick. It pairs well with the 90-degree
rotations plugin ().

<div class="p"><!----></div>
     <h3><a name="tth_sEc3.3.2">
3.3.2</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;OpenGL</h3>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
KiNG is capable of using OpenGL rendering commands to take advantage
of your graphics hardware and get (hopefully) accelerated graphics
performance. You'll need to have an up-to-date version of Java installed,
along with the JOGL libraries (<a href="https://jogl.dev.java.net/"><tt>https://jogl.dev.java.net/</tt></a>).
Make sure you get both <tt>jogl.jar</tt> and the native library or
libraries (they end in <tt>.dll</tt>, <tt>.so</tt>, or <tt>.jnilib</tt>).
<em>2008 update</em>: It is no longer necessary to download separate
files; everything needed is included in the platform specific downloads
at the JOGL site. The download includes directions for installing
JOGL (which discourage dropping the JAR files in the extension directories
as originally recommended). Essentially, the JOGL JAR and the GLUEGEN_RT
JAR need to be added to the classpath in order for JOGL to work. If
you downloaded a platform-specific version of KiNG, the necessary
libraries may already be included.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
This feature has been tested with various combinations of Java 1.4.2
through Java 1.6.0 and JOGL 1.1 through JOGL 1.1.1. JOGL is still
under development, as is this feature, and interacting so directly
with the hardware is always risky, so it's possible that OpenGL rendering
may hang KiNG on your computer. You've been warned.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Hopefully, a future version of Java (possibly the 1.6.x series) will
use OpenGL behind the scenes for all graphics operations, making KiNG
much faster and making this feature obsolete. Until then, this is
a work-around for large kinemages where performance is an issue.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 <h2><a name="tth_sEc3.4">
3.4</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Master buttons</h2>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Not all the buttons to the right of the graphics control groups and
subgroups of points; some are "masters." The master buttons
sit below the others, separated by a spacer. When activated, a master
turns on all the groups it controls; when deactivated, it turns them
all off. The effects are only momentary; the group can be turned on
or off directly regardless of the state of the master(s) that control
it.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
A single group can be controlled by multiple masters. Note that the
"off" state of a master is dominant in this case: a master will
always turn off the groups it controls, but will turn them on only
if they are not also controlled by another master that is already
off. Since the buttons of the individual groups, subgroups, and lists
are sometimes hidden, one can generate a variety of patterns by turning
the masters on and off in specific patterns.

 <h1><a name="tth_chAp4">
Chapter 4 </a><br />Kinemage authoring: Using KiNG to edit a kinemage</h1>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Kinemage files are stored as human-readable, plain-text files. They're
also designed to be easily edited by human beings, using a text editor
like Notepad (Windows), TextEdit (Mac), or vi (Unix). You can also
use a word processor like Microsoft Word, but you have to be careful
to save as plain text (.txt) rather than formatted text (.doc and
others). A description of the kinemage file format is distributed
with KiNG as a separate document from this manual.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 <h2><a name="tth_sEc4.1">
4.1</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Merging kinemages together</h2>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The most basic sort of editing is to combine two kinemages into one.
For this, simply use the <tt>File  -  Append</tt> command (see ).

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 <h2><a name="tth_sEc4.2">
4.2</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Editing text</h2>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The text of a kinemage is often critical for clarifying and amplifying
its meaning. It's analogous to the caption that accompanies a printed
figure. You can edit the kinemage text in the same window that you
use for reading it (just press the <tt>Show text</tt> button).

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 <h2><a name="tth_sEc4.3">
4.3</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Editing views</h2>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
A simple editing tool is <tt>Views  -  Save current view</tt>, which
records the current orientation and position of the kinemage as a
new view in the <tt>Views</tt> menu. Creating a series of meaningful,
clearly labeled views is a great way to make a kinemage more informative.
You can delete, rename, and rearrange views using <tt>Views  - 
Edit saved views</tt>.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 <h2><a name="tth_sEc4.4">
4.4</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;The hierarchy editor</h2>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
One of the goals of KiNG is to enable simple, visual editing of most
parts of a kinemage. Many of the editing commands are activated using
a tree-like display of the hierarchical kinemage structure, which
will resemble the layout of buttons.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The structure of the kinemage can be rearranged by cutting, copying,
and pasting elements; creating new elements and deleting unneeded
ones; and reordering elements (using the <tt>Up</tt> and <tt>Down</tt>
commands). Play with these commands, and their operation will soon
become obvious. Elements can even be cut out of one kinemage and pasted
into another!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Also, the properties of individual elements can be adjusted, which
allows them to be renamed. What other properties are available depends
on the level of the hierarchy (kinemage, group, subgroup, or list).
Each element can also be toggled on and off, even if it doesn't have
a button visible in the button pane.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Using the hierarchy editor effectively depends on a decent understanding
of the kinemage format. If you're unfamiliar with kinemages, reading
the kinemage format reference may be very helpful to you.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 <h2><a name="tth_sEc5.1">
5.1</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Understanding the Tools and Plug-ins</h2>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The <tt>Tools</tt> menu has a variety of tools and plug-ins for interacting
with the kinemage. Many of these are highly domain-specific - tailored
to doing structural biology, for example. Each tool "takes over"
the mouse, assigning specific meanings to the various kinds of clicks
and drags. Normally, the familiar Navigate tool is active, so mouse
motions result in the sort of rotations, pans, and zooms that most
users are accustomed to.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Plug-ins, on the other hand, just offer additional functionality that
doesn't change what the mouse does. Because of this, you can have
several plug-ins active at once, but only one tool.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Some special-purpose tools and plugins have been developed by other
people and ship separately from KiNG. Installing these additional
tools and plugins for KiNG is easy, though. Just take all plugin files
that end with <tt>.jar</tt> (<em>e.g.</em>, <tt>chiropraxis.jar</tt>,
<tt>pyking.jar</tt>) and put them in the <tt>plugins/</tt> folder
that's part of your KiNG distribution. There will probably be a few
JAR files in there already. Then just close KiNG and restart it to
load the new tools and plugins. Note that these will <em>not</em> be
available when running KiNG as an applet.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The tools menu also has some other options that are related to how
mouse clicks and drags are interpretted, which are discussed below.
The tools and plugins listed in the menu can be rearranged, grouped
into submenus, or hidden entirely by using the <tt>Tools  -  Customize</tt>
dialog box, which is also accessible from <tt>Edit  -  Configure
KiNG</tt>.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
     <h3><a name="tth_sEc5.1.1">
5.1.1</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Extra measurements</h3>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
In addition to tracking the distance between the last two points,
clicking on points to identify them can track the angle between the
last three points and the dihedral angle between the last four. When
these measurements are active, the <tt>Markers</tt> option will display
four markers instead of two.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
     <h3><a name="tth_sEc5.1.2">
5.1.2</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;XYZ coordinates</h3>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Likewise, KiNG can display the original, unrotated coordinates of
the point. This is sometimes helpful when the kinemage is a graph
or plot of some data, and the position has some absolute meaning.
The display of this information can be enabled in the <tt>Tools</tt>
menu.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
     <h3><a name="tth_sEc5.1.3">
5.1.3</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Pick objects</h3>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Traditionally, one can only "pick" points in a kinemage. Enabling
this option allows KiNG to recognize mouse clicks that hit the actual
lines drawn between points and the surfaces of triangles. In each
case, the result is equivalent to clicking on the point that determines
the attributes (color, line width, etc.) of that graphics object.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 <h2><a name="tth_sEc5.2">
5.2</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Using KiNG with a multi-button mouse</h2>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
In KiNG, even a one-button mouse is sufficient to access all of the
available functions. However, it has also been designed to take full
advantage of a three-button wheel mouse. The primary function of every
tool is accessed by clicking or dragging with the left (or only) mouse
button. This button is referred to as "Normal" in the command
reference charts.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Other functions can be accessed either by holding down keyboard keys
at the same time, or by using one of the other mouse buttons. Holding
the Shift key is equivalent to using the right mouse button, and holding
the Control key (often written Ctrl) is equivalent to using the middle
mouse button. A few tools assign some function to a mouse action with
both the Shift and Control keys held down. In this case, you can get
the same effect when dragging by depressing both the left and right
mouse button. Because of the difficulty of clicking two buttons at
once, however, this shortcut does not apply to Shift+Ctrl+Click.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
At the present time, the Shift and Control keys do not work properly
in Java on Mac OS X. When using a one-button mouse with OS X, you
should use the Command key (a.k.a. Open Apple) instead of Shift to
get the same effect as the right mouse button, and you should use
the Option key (a.k.a. Alt) instead of Control to get the same effect
as the middle mouse button. Hopefully this will be fixed in OS X 10.4
/ Java 1.5.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Some tools also use the up &amp; down arrow keys on the keyboard; these
have the same effect as using the scroll wheel of a wheel mouse. Once
again, these may be combined with the Shift and/or Control keys to
give access to more functions. Note that the mouse wheel is never
active when running in a Java 1.3.x virtual machine; Java 1.4 or later
is needed to take advantage of this control.

5.3</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Navigate: Exploring in 3-D<a name="navigate-tool">
</a></h2>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The Navigate tool encompasses all the usual modes of interacting with
a kinemage. This is the tool that is active when KiNG is launched,
and is probably the only tool many people will ever use. See 
for an introduction to using the Navigate tool to get around a kinemage.
There are also a few more advanced modes of movement which are described
below.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
     <h3><a name="tth_sEc5.3.1">
5.3.1</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Z-rotation ("pinwheel")</h3>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Clicking and dragging (with the left mouse button) near the top of
the graphics area will cause the kinemage to spin around the Z axis
like a pinwheel, rather than the more conventional sort of rotation.
This is sometimes useful for putting something right side up.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
     <h3><a name="tth_sEc5.3.2">
5.3.2</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Translation ("flatland")</h3>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Holding Control while dragging (or dragging with the middle mouse
button) allows one to slide the kinemage around in the plane of the
screen. Dragging at the top of the screen, as for z-rotation, slides
the kinemage in and out of the plane of the screen. (Note: enabling
perspective in the <tt>Diplay</tt> menu is <em>very</em> helpful when
translating in and out of the plane of the screen.) This sort of motion
is sometimes called "panning" or "flatland," and can be
made the default mode of movement by selecting <tt>Tools  -  Flatland</tt>.

5.4</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Draw New: Reworking the kinemage<a name="drawnew-tool">
</a></h2>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The Draw New tool provides a variety of simple tools for creating
new objects in the kinemage or removing existing ones on a point-by-point
basis.

<dl compact="compact">
 <dt><b>Edit&nbsp;list&nbsp;props</b></dt>
	<dd> Picking a point opens the editing window for
that point's list, where you can set color, width, radius, <em>etc</em>.
You will need to activate the <tt>Tools  -  Superpick</tt> option to
edit unpickable points.</dd>
 <dt><b>Edit&nbsp;point&nbsp;props</b></dt>
	<dd> Picking a point opens the editing window for
that point, where you can set color, position, point ID, <em>etc</em>.
You will need to activate the <tt>Tools  -  Superpick</tt> option to
edit unpickable points.</dd>
 <dt><b>Move&nbsp;points</b></dt>
	<dd> Allows you to click on individual points and drag
them around to new positions. Dragging them with the mouse moves them
in the plane of the screen. Using the mouse wheel or up &amp; down arrow
keys moves them in and out (this is easier to see with Perspective
enabled and Stereo on). A kinemage may have several "points"
at the same location in 3-D. Under normal conditions, this tool will
move them all together, so that lines stay connected and everything
behaves just as you would expect. However, you can also use Ctrl+Drag
to pick apart overlapped points and separate them from each other.
You will need to activate the <tt>Tools  -  Superpick</tt> option to
move unpickable points.</dd>
 <dt><b>Draw&nbsp;line&nbsp;segments</b></dt>
	<dd> Simply draws a line between the first point
picked and the second. Every pair of picks forms a new line. Lines
can be shortened from their natural length (or lengthened, using negative
numbers), which is sometimes useful for making illustrations.</dd>
 <dt><b>Draw&nbsp;dotted&nbsp;lines</b></dt>
	<dd> Like drawing ordinary lines, except a string
of dots is created instead of a single line. The number of dots is
configurable. This can serve as a "template" for constructing
more complex dot-dash patterns when used with line drawing and prune.</dd>
 <dt><b>Draw&nbsp;curved&nbsp;arc</b></dt>
	<dd> Draws an arc from the second point picked to
the third one, with the arc curving toward the first point picked.
The user specifies how many degrees out of a circle will be used to
create the arc, so small numbers give flat arcs and large numbers
give exagerated ones. The arc can also be shortened by a few degrees
so it doesn't quite touch its endpoints, and a four-pronged arrowhead
can be added.</dd>
 <dt><b>Draw&nbsp;balls</b></dt>
	<dd> Places a small ball at each point picked with the
mouse.</dd>
 <dt><b>Draw&nbsp;labels</b></dt>
	<dd> Creates a label at the picked point, with its text
taken from the picked point's ID. The label text can be changed using
Edit Properties.</dd>
 <dt><b>Draw&nbsp;dots</b></dt>
	<dd> Creates a dot at each point picked with the mouse.</dd>
 <dt><b>Draw&nbsp;triangles</b></dt>
	<dd> Draws a triangle for each set of three points
picked. Triangles can also be shrunk (values between 0 and 1) or grown
(values greater than 1). A value of zero will make an infinitely small
triangle; a value of one will give a triangle that just touches the
three points.</dd>
 <dt><b>Prune&nbsp;one&nbsp;point</b></dt>
	<dd> Removes the single point picked with the mouse.
In the case of polylines and triangle strips, it will stop things
from being drawn that depend on the removed point. That is, lines
drawn to and from the point will be removed, and all triangles involving
the point will be removed. Sometimes kinemages have multiple points
that overlap in the same spatial location, so it may take multiple
clicks to remove all the objects at a particular point in space.</dd>
 <dt><b>Punch&nbsp;a&nbsp;polyline</b></dt>
	<dd> Removes all the line segments in a particular
<em>polyline</em> (a series of lines drawn head to tail). This is sometimes
useful with vectors and triangles; for other things, it behaves like
prune.</dd>
 <dt><b>Auger&nbsp;a&nbsp;region</b></dt>
	<dd> Removes all points that fall under the giant
eraser. The eraser is drawn as a large circle that follows the mouse
around the graphics area. Auger operations cannot be undone, so save
your file first and click carefully.</dd>
 <dt><b>Spherical&nbsp;crop</b></dt>
	<dd> Removes all points that fall more than a specified
distance away from the picked point. Only visible points are cropped.
Crop operations cannot be undone, so save your file first and click
carefully.</dd>
 <dt><b>New&nbsp;subgroup</b></dt>
	<dd> Kinemage elements created by each drawing option
are placed into their own list, and all of those lists are placed
in one subgroup under the "New group" group created by this
tool. Creating a new subgroup starts a fresh list for each option
above. This is a good way to separate out the different objects you're
drawing. New subgroup can't be undone, but it's pretty harmless.</dd>
 <dt><b>Undo</b></dt>
	<dd> The Undo button undoes the last drawing action, with a few
exceptions (mentioned above). Undo depth is unlimited, subject to
memory constraints. Thus, for kinemages that aren't too large you
can often undo all the drawing operations you've performed since loading
the kinemage.</dd>

5.5</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Electron Density: Visualizing maps<a name="edmap-plugin">
</a></h2>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
This plug-in is for viewing electron density maps while exploring
kinemages of crystal structures. (If that doesn't mean anything to
you, then you probably don't need this plugin.)

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Choose <tt>Open</tt> from the <tt>Tools</tt> menu in order to open
a map file. Supported formats include X-PLOR (ASCII, not binary),
O (DSN6 or Brix), and CCP4 (mode 2, the only one in common use).

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Each map opens a new control window, which allows adjustment of its
extent, color, and level. The segment of map that is visible at any
given time is centered in the current view; when the view changes,
the portion that is visible will automatically be updated.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Any dynamic segment of map can be captured
as part of a static kinemage; just use the <tt>Export</tt> button
to make the currently visible map segment part of the current kinemage.
When you've finished with a map, be sure to <tt>Discard</tt> it to
free up the memory it consumed.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
If you don't have an electron density map for the structure you're
interested in, you can try looking at the Uppsala Electron Density
Server (<a href="http://fsrv1.bmc.uu.se/eds/"><tt>http://fsrv1.bmc.uu.se/eds/</tt></a>). They offer standard maps
for many of the structures deposited in the Protein Data Bank.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Maps can't be loaded from the local filesystem when KiNG is running
as an applet due to security restrictions. However, you can use the
<tt>XMAP</tt> or <tt>OMAP</tt> parameter along with the <tt>&lt;PARAM&#62;</tt>
tag to load a (single) map from a URL. For example:

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<dl compact="compact">
 <dt><b></b></dt>
	<dd>
&lt;PARAM&nbsp;name=omap&nbsp;value=http://example.com/electron/density/my-protein.dsn6.gz&#62;
</dd>
</dl>
You can also use the <tt>EDMAPBASE</tt> and <tt>EDMAPLIST</tt> parameters
to allow the user to select and load a map. <tt>EDMAPBASE</tt> specifies
a path to the maps relative to the current document base URL. <tt>EDMAPLIST</tt>
is a space-separated list of filenames that can be loaded from that
path. Users can also enter and modify URLs directly, though obviously
this isn't very convenient.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 <h2><a name="tth_sEc5.6">
5.6</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Update KiNG: Upgrading without the hassle<a name="update-plugin">
</a></h2>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The Update KiNG plugin allows you to quickly and easily update KiNG
to the latest version published on the Kinemage website (kinemage.biochem.duke.edu).
After you confirm your intentions, KiNG will begin downloading the
new version. If the download proceeds too slowly, you can cancel with
no changes to KiNG. Once complete, the downloaded version will be
unpacked in the same place as your current installed version of KiNG,
and the existing version will be overwritten. You can then quit KiNG
and restart to take advantage of new features and capabilities.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The Update plugin has been tested on a variety of platforms under
a variety of conditions, but there is always a chance that it won't
work quite right on <em>your</em> computer. The chance is greater if
you created a non-standard custom installation from the JAR files
rather than using the pre-packaged platform-specific installer. If
KiNG fails to start after the update, you may have to remove it and
then download and install a clean copy by hand.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
There are certain things the automatic updater <em>can't</em> update,
like the bundled binary programs (<tt>probe</tt>, <em>etc</em>.) or
the displayed version number of the Mac application bundle. For this
reason, you may want to periodically remove the existing installation
completely and reinstall from scratch.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 <h1><a name="tth_chAp6">
Chapter 6 </a><br />Configuring KiNG</h1>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
By choosing <tt>Edit  -  Configure KiNG</tt>, one can adjust several
aspects of KiNG's behavior and appearance, such as font sizes, stereo
settings, and whether or not certain warnings are issued. The configuration
dialog also allows for reorganizing the <tt>Tools</tt> menu to suit
your own work habits. Preferrences may be saved to disk, where they
are stored in a simple text file named <tt>.king_prefs</tt> in the
user's home directory. There may be some settings accessible only
through this file; that is, they cannot be edited from the graphical
interface. Nonetheless, pressing <tt>Reset to defaults</tt> will restore
them to their standard values.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Note that due to security restrictions, configurations cannot be saved
when KiNG is running as an applet. However, the web page creator may
provide a custom configuration file in the same format as the one
saved by KiNG the application, thereby altering the default behavior
for all visitors to the website. If you create a preferences file
named <tt>MyKingPrefs.txt</tt> and place it in the same directory
as <tt>king.jar</tt> and your HTML file, add something like this to
the <tt>APPLET</tt> tag of your webpage:

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<dl compact="compact">
 <dt><b></b></dt>
	<dd>
&lt;param&nbsp;name="king_prefs"&nbsp;value="MyKingPrefs.txt"&#62;

 <h1><a name="tth_chAp7">
Chapter 7 </a><br />Launching KiNG</h1>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
KiNG runs both as a stand-alone application, and as an applet that
can be included in web pages. In any case, KiNG requires a Java Virtual
Machine (JVM), version 1.5 or higher. You can get Java from <a href="http://java.sun.com"><tt>http://java.sun.com</tt></a>.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 <h2><a name="tth_sEc7.1">
7.1</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Running KiNG as an application</h2>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
How you launch the KiNG application will depend on what operating
system (Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, <em>etc</em>.) you're using. With
Windows and the Mac, you can usually just double-click on the <tt>king.jar</tt>
file to start KiNG.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
On all operating systems, you can type

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<dl compact="compact">
 <dt><b></b></dt>
	<dd>
java&nbsp;-jar&nbsp;king.jar&nbsp;[-merge&nbsp; - &nbsp;-single]&nbsp;[file1&nbsp;file2&nbsp;...]
</dd>
</dl>
All the files listed on the command line will be merged together into
one kinemage, unless the <tt>-s</tt> flag is included, in which case
all the files will be opened as separate kinemages. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
As of KiNG 2.16, the files KiNG can read in from the command line
include kinemages, PDB, mmCIF, and electron density maps. For the
structure files, QuickKin is used to generate quick-browsing ribbon+stick
representations of the structures.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 <h2><a name="tth_sEc7.2">
7.2</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Making KiNG an applet in a web page</h2>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
KiNG can also be included as a web page applet. The following HTML
code is a simple example that uses the &lt;APPLET&#62; tag, which will work
with browsers using a recent JVM. Older browsers may need &lt;OBJECT&#62;
or &lt;EMBED&#62; tags; more information on this is available from Sun Microsystems,
Inc.

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<dl compact="compact">
 <dt><b></b></dt>
	<dd>
&lt;applet&nbsp;code="king/Kinglet.class"&nbsp;archive="king.jar"&nbsp;width=300&nbsp;height=150&#62;

<div class="p"><!----></div>
&lt;param&nbsp;name="kinSource"&nbsp;value="some_file_name.kin"&#62;

<div class="p"><!----></div>
&lt;/applet&#62;
</dd>
</dl>
Just put all the jar files, including king.jar, in the same directory
as the HTML file. Users who visit the page will see a 300x150 KiNG
logo in the web page, along with a floating KiNG window that looks
very much like the stand-alone application. However, due to security
restrictions imposed by the browser environment, some functions (<em>e.g.</em>,
saving files) will be disabled.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Note that the <tt>code</tt> property really must have the value <tt>king/Kinglet.class</tt>,
<em>even though</em> <tt><em>king.jar</em></tt> <em>is not in a sub-directory
called</em> <tt><em>king/</em></tt>. This is the most common problem that
people have when trying to run KiNG as an applet. If you did place
<tt>king.jar</tt> somewhere else, that path should precede the jar
file name in the <tt>archive</tt> property instead.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
If you want to include additional jar files for plugins and tools,
you need to list those in the <tt>archive</tt> field, after <tt>king.jar</tt>,
separated by commas. For example:

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<dl compact="compact">
 <dt><b></b></dt>
	<dd>
&lt;applet&nbsp;code="king/Kinglet.class"&nbsp;archive="king.jar,chiropraxis.jar,extratools.jar"&nbsp;width=300&nbsp;height=150&#62;
</dd>
</dl>
It is possible to run KiNG in two other applet modes to achieve a
slightly different effect. First, the large KiNG logo can be replaced
with a small one that serves as a launcher button. Thus, loading the
main window is defered until the user clicks the button, at which
time the main window appears and the kinemage is loaded. Below is
sample HTML for this effect. Note the smaller width and height, to
account for the small size of the button.

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<dl compact="compact">
 <dt><b></b></dt>
	<dd>
&lt;applet&nbsp;code="king/Kinglet.class"&nbsp;archive="king.jar"&nbsp;width=60&nbsp;height=21&#62;

<div class="p"><!----></div>
&lt;param&nbsp;name="mode"&nbsp;value="launcher"&#62;

<div class="p"><!----></div>
&lt;param&nbsp;name="kinSource"&nbsp;value="some_file_name.kin"&#62;

<div class="p"><!----></div>
&lt;/applet&#62;
</dd>
</dl>
If you would like a custom image for the launcher, specify its URL
with the <tt>launcherImage</tt> parameter. You may need to change
the applet width/height to match. If no image is specified, the default
one will be used.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Second, the applet can be embedded in the web page (rather than floating
in its own window), by placing this line inside the &lt;applet&#62; tags
instead:

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<dl compact="compact">
 <dt><b></b></dt>
	<dd>
&lt;param&nbsp;name="mode"&nbsp;value="flat"&#62;
</dd>
</dl>
One also probably wants to specify a larger width and/or height, possibly
as a fraction of the page size (<em>e.g.</em> 95%). Be warned that
using KiNG this way may not work well in some browsers; test your
pages thoroughly.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Normally, a KiNG applet displays only the kinemage specified in its
<tt>kinSource</tt> parameter. However, you can also use the <tt>kinfileBase</tt>
and <tt>kinfileList</tt> parameters to allow the user to open and/or
append additional kinemages from a pre-specified set. <tt>kinfileBase</tt>
specifies a path to the maps relative to the current document base
URL. <tt>kinfileList</tt> is a space-separated list of filenames that
can be loaded from that path. Users can also enter and modify URLs
directly, though obviously this isn't very convenient.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The KiNG applet also supports a <tt>kinfileSaveHandler</tt> parameter,
which is the URL of a CGI script that can accept HTTP POST kinemage
output. On a properly configured webserver, this allows users of the
KiNG applet to save their modified kinemages directly to the server!
However, this is definitely a custom programming job on the server
side and so is not an option for most "normal" uses of the KiNG
applet.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Some Tools and Plugins may define their own &lt;PARAM&#62; tags, which will
be described in their documentation.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
As of KiNG version 2.16, the KiNG applet can read PDB or CIF files
as well as kinemages. In order to supply a PDB or CIF file for KiNG,
instead of the <tt>kinSource</tt> parameter, use <tt>pdbSource</tt>
or <tt>pdbFile</tt>. This feature uses QuickKin to generate a quick
ribbons and stick representation of the input file.

9.3</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Acknowledgments</h2>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I owe an enormous debt of gratitude to many, many people for making
this program possible. First and foremost, I thank David and Jane
Richardson, who are my bosses and mentors, and who developed the kinemage
concept, the file format, and most of the features found in KiNG -
my contribution was only the Java implementation. Second, I thank
Vincent Chen for his ongoing contributions to KiNG; he has developed
many useful plugins and has made significant contributions to the
core. I am also grateful to the other members of the Richardson lab,
who have supported and encouraged me in developing KiNG, providing
invaluable insight into how to improve the program. Of course, this
work would not have been possible without support from the National
Institutes of Health and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
KiNG is free software built on free software. I can't hope to acknowledge
all the authors of all the software that has been used to create KiNG,
but I can mention a few of the most prominent: Sun Microsystems, the
creators of the Java language and libraries; the LY<!--hbox-->X document processor,
used for writing the documentation; jEdit, a fantastic programmer's
text editor written entirely in Java; and the entire Linux movement,
for providing a real alternative to comercial operating systems. I
have also taken advantage of a number of excellent free Java libraries,
which are described above.
