 id="x1-30001.1"></a>What is a kinemage?</h3>
<!--l. 70--><p class="noindent">A kinemage is a &#8220;kinetic image,&#8221; an interactive, three-dimensional illustration. Because
kinemages contain simple geometric objects &#8212; points, lines, spheres, <span 
class="ptmri8t-">etc. </span>&#8212; they are suited
to a great variety of subjects, from simple sketches to sophisticated plots to detailed
schematics of 3-D objects. Their strength is in <span 
class="ptmri8t-">selective </span>presentation of information &#8212; they
were originally intended as an alternative to flat, static illustrations in scientific
journals.
<!--l. 78--><p class="indent">   In fact, kinemages were first created as a way of visualizing macromolecular structures,
particularly x-ray crystal structures of proteins. However, such a kinemage is a <span 
class="ptmri8t-">drawing </span>of a
molecule, albeit a 3-D drawing, and not the molecule itself. Thus, the kinemage lacks most of
the information in a PDB file, and kinemage display program cannot read PDB files directly.
Since their creation, kinemages have been extended to a variety of other fields, from the
social sciences to ecology to education.
<!--l. 87--><p class="indent">   The kinemage concept is the brainchild of Drs. David and Jane Richardson
at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina, USA. Their website is at <span class="obeylines-h"><a 
href="http://kinemage.biochem.duke.edu" class="url" ><span

   <h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">1.2    </span> <a 
 id="x1-40001.2"></a>Starting the KiNG program</h3>
<!--l. 94--><p class="noindent">If you&#8217;re reading this, you may already have KiNG running. In that case, feel free to skip
this section. If not, we&#8217;ll guide you through getting KiNG up and running on your
system.
<!--l. 99--><p class="noindent">
   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">1.2.1    </span> <a 
 id="x1-50001.2.1"></a>Download KiNG</h4>
<!--l. 101--><p class="noindent">If you don&#8217;t already have a copy of KiNG, you can download it from <span class="obeylines-h"><a 
href="http://kinemage.biochem.duke.edu" class="url" ><span 
class="pcrr8tn-">http://kinemage.biochem.duke.edu</span></a></span>. Even if you have a copy already, you might check
periodically for new version that add features and fix bugs. If you run on a Windows or Linux
machine and aren&#8217;t already knowledgeable about Java techonology, we recommend
downloading the package that includes a Java Virtual Machine in the bundle. (This isn&#8217;t an
issue for Macintosh owners.)
<!--l. 109--><p class="indent">   If you just want to run KiNG as an applet on MolProbity or some other web page,
you can skip this step. You can always download a copy later if you want to run it
off-line.
<!--l. 114--><p class="noindent">
   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">1.2.2    </span> <a 
 id="x1-60001.2.2"></a>Make sure you have Java</h4>

<!--l. 116--><p class="noindent">KiNG is written in the Java programming language, and so requires that the Java libraries
(version 1.3 or later) be present on your computer in order for it to run. Newer
Apple computers (those running Mac OS X) come with Java. Most PCs do not,
though recently several manufacturers have agreed to pre-install Java on their new
computers. Look for the coffee-cup icon in your Windows task bar or in the Control
Panel.
<!--l. 124--><p class="indent">   If you don&#8217;t have Java, you may have downloaded a copy of KiNG that was bundled with
its own installation of Java. If you ran the InstallAnywhere installation program, this is
the copy you have; don&#8217;t worry about downloading and installing another copy of
Java.
<!--l. 129--><p class="indent">   If you don&#8217;t have Java and you didn&#8217;t download the bundled version of KiNG, point your
web browser to <span class="obeylines-h"><a 
href="http://java.sun.com/getjava/index.html" class="url" ><span 
class="pcrr8tn-">http://java.sun.com/getjava/index.html</span></a></span>. The software is free and
available for Windows, Linux, and Solaris computers. We recommend getting the newest
version that is available (1.4.2 as of this writing).
<!--l. 136--><p class="noindent">
   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">1.2.3    </span> <a 
 id="x1-70001.2.3"></a>Launch KiNG</h4>
<!--l. 138--><p class="noindent">Launching KiNG is as simple as double clicking on the &#8220;KiNG&#8221; icon. If you didn&#8217;t
download a package with an installer, <span 
class="ptmri8t-">etc. </span>you may need to click on <span 
class="pcrr8tn-">king.jar</span>
instead.
<!--l. 142--><p class="indent">   For Unix types who want a shell script, we recommend something like this:
<!--l. 145--><p class="noindent">
     <dl class="list1"><dt class="list">
     </dt><dd 
class="list">
     <span 
class="pcrr8tn-">#!/bin/sh</span>
     <!--l. 148--><p class="noindent"><span 
class="pcrr8tn-">exec</span><span 
class="pcrr8tn-">&#x00A0;java</span><span 
class="pcrr8tn-">&#x00A0;-Xms32m</span><span 
class="pcrr8tn-">&#x00A0;-Xmx128m</span><span 
class="pcrr8tn-">&#x00A0;-jar</span><span 
class="pcrr8tn-">&#x00A0;/home/ian/bin/jars/king.jar</span><span 
class="pcrr8tn-">&#x00A0;&#8221;$@&#8221;</span></dd></dl>
<!--l. 150--><p class="noindent">The <span 
class="pcrr8tn-">-Xms </span>and <span 
class="pcrr8tn-">-Xmx </span>switches control the amount of memory initially allocated to the Java
program and the maximum memory it can consume. The default maximum of 64 MB should
be enough for almost any kinemage, but a few of the largest require more (hence the
<span 
class="pcrr8tn-">-Xmx128m </span>recommendation).
<!--l. 156--><p class="indent">   If you just want to run KiNG as an applet from a web page, you can just visit that web
page now. If you don&#8217;t see the &#8220;Kinglet&#8221; logo after a minute or two, make sure your browser
is properly configured to work with Java. How you do this depends on which browser you
have; consult its documentation for details.

<!--l. 181--><p class="noindent">A kinemage is a dynamic, 3-D illustration. The best way to take advantage of that is by
rotating it and twisting it around. Just click the mouse near the center of the graphics window
and slowly drag right or left, up or down. If you have multiple buttons on your mouse, use the
left button or button 1. You can also use the left and right arrow keys for small
rotations. If you get lost or disoriented, use the <span

label associated with each point will appear in the bottom right of the graphics area.
Furthermore, the distance from this point to the last one you clicked will also be

 id="x1-140001.4.1.4"></a>Turning groups on &amp; off</h5>
<!--l. 207--><p class="noindent">Most kinemages have many different components to them, grouped together in logical ways.
A protein might have one group for each subunit; or one group for mainchain, another for
side chains, and yet another for hydrogens. Groups and subgroups are given names and
can be made visible or hidden by the viewer &#8212; you might want to see only one
subunit, or only the backbone (without sidechains and hydrogens cluttering up the

view).
<!--l. 215--><p class="indent">   The groups and subgroups appear in the button pane, to the right of the graphics
area. Each one has a button to turn it on or off. Groups that are on (visible) usually
have a check mark or an X in there box; a blank button means the group is hidden.
Many kinemages start off with some information hidden, to avoid overwhelming the
reader. Always check to see if there&#8217;s more information available than is being
displayed!

   <h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">1.4.1.5    </span> <a 
 id="x1-150001.4.1.5"></a>Re-centering</h5>
<!--l. 225--><p class="noindent">You can make any point in the kinemage be the center. The center point will be in the middle
of the graphics area, and the kinemage will rotate about that point. There are several ways to
set the center: you can hold the Shift key while you click the point, or use the right mouse
button if you have one. You can also press the <span 
class="pcrr8tn-">Pick center </span>button below the graphics area
and then click on the desired point.
<!--l. 233--><p class="indent">   Since re-centering brings a point to the center of the screen, using this repeatedly allows
one to &#8220;walk&#8221; through a large structure.

<!--l. 239--><p class="noindent">KiNG allows you to zoom in to see small details in a kinemage. Use the <span 
class="pcrr8tn-">Zoom </span>slider, below
the graphics area, to control how far you zoom in. You can click the mouse right or left of the
knob for small movements or click the knob and drag it for larger ones. A small motion is
usually all that&#8217;s needed.
<!--l. 245--><p class="indent">   For easier access, one can hold Shift and drag (or drag using the right mouse button) in
the graphics window. Dragging down zooms in; up zooms out. The up/down arrow keys and
mouse wheel (Java 1.4 and later only) also control zooming.

<!--l. 268--><p class="noindent">Exploring on your own is great, but the best guide to a kinemage is its author. Often, he
or she includes a short text of a few paragraphs or pages that explains what the
kinemage depicts. You can access this text using the <span

<!--l. 278--><p class="noindent">Most kinemages have one or more &#8220;views&#8221; that were selected by the author to highlight some
significant feature. These views are accessible from the <span 
class="pcrr8tn-">Views </span>menu. Just click on one of the
named views and the kinemage will &#8220;jump&#8221; to that view. You can then rotate it, zoom in or
out, <span

from the menu.
<!--l. 286--><p class="indent">   Kinemages without any predefined views still get an automatic &#8220;overview&#8221; view. This is
a useful way to return to a known starting point if you get lost in a complicated

<!--l. 305--><p class="noindent">To open a new kinemage, go the the <span 
class="pcrr8tn-">File </span>menu and choose <span 
class="pcrr8tn-">Open</span>. Browse through
your file system and find a kinemage file. These files typically end in .<span 
class="pcrr8tn-">kin</span>. The
new version-control convention is to name modified files <span 
class="pcrr8tn-">.1.kin</span>, <span 
class="pcrr8tn-">.2.kin</span>, <span 
class="ptmri8t-">etc</span>.,
though older kinemages that have been edited may have revisions named .<span 
class="pcrr8tn-">kip</span>,
<span 
class="pcrr8tn-">kip1</span>, <span 
class="pcrr8tn-">kip2</span>, <span 
class="ptmri8t-">etc</span>. Click the button marked OK and KiNG will begin loading the file.
You&#8217;ll see a progress bar as KiNG loads the contents of the file, and then the first
kinemage in that file will be displayed in the graphics area (where the logo used to
be).
<!--l. 316--><p class="indent">   You can also drag and drop kinemages into the KiNG graphics window in order to open
them, but this feature is not supported for Java versions prior to 1.4. On Mac OS X machines,
you can also double-click <span 
class="pcrr8tn-">.kin </span>files in the Finder or drag kinemage files onto the KiNG Dock
icon to launch KiNG and open the file.
<!--l. 322--><p class="indent">   Additionally, files can be specified on the command line, as in <span 
class="pcrr8tn-">king</span><span 
class="pcrr8tn-">&#x00A0;-s</span><span 
class="pcrr8tn-">&#x00A0;foo.kin</span><span 
class="pcrr8tn-">&#x00A0;bar.kin</span>,
which will load all the kinemages in those two files upon startup. The <span 
class="pcrr8tn-">-s </span>(or <span 
class="pcrr8tn-">-single</span>) flag is
required so that KiNG knows not to merge the two files together.

   <h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">2.2    </span> <a 
 id="x1-240002.2"></a>Working with multiple kinemages</h3>
<!--l. 330--><p class="noindent">If your file has more than one kinemage, you can choose which one you want to look at from
the drop box on the right, just above the buttons. You can also use <span 
class="pcrr8tn-">File </span>| <span 
class="pcrr8tn-">Open </span>to load
additional files; those kinemages will also appear in the drop box. When you&#8217;re done, use
<span 
class="pcrr8tn-">File </span>| <span 
class="pcrr8tn-">Close </span>to get rid of the current kinemage, or use <span 
class="pcrr8tn-">File </span>| <span 
class="pcrr8tn-">Close all </span>to get rid of all the
open kinemages.
<!--l. 338--><p class="indent">   If you save your file when more than one kinemage is open, they will <span 
class="ptmri8t-">all </span>be written
out to that file, in the order they currently appear in. This is an easy way to create
multi-kinemage files, but be careful that you don&#8217;t save <span 
class="ptmri8t-">more </span>than you intended
to!

   <h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">2.3    </span> <a 
 id="x1-250002.3"></a>Appending a kinemage</h3>
<!--l. 346--><p class="noindent">Sometimes you want to combine the contents of multiple kinemages. You might
want to combine a graph of your latest sales data with some nicely formated and
labeled axes you prepared last month. Or maybe you want to combine a ribbon
drawing of your favorite protein with a representation of the atomic detail at its
active site. In either case, using <span 
class="pcrr8tn-">File | Append </span>will combine the contents of a
new file with the contents of the currently displayed kinemage. Be careful &#8212; if
the new file contains multiple kinemages, they&#8217;ll <span 
class="ptmri8t-">all </span>be merged into the current
one!

<!--l. 356--><p class="indent">   This behavior can be achieved on the command line by specifying multiple files, as in
<span 
class="pcrr8tn-">king</span><span 
class="pcrr8tn-">&#x00A0;-m</span><span 
class="pcrr8tn-">&#x00A0;foo.kin</span><span

startup. The <span 
class="pcrr8tn-">-m </span>(or <span

behavior.

   <h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">2.4    </span> <a 
 id="x1-260002.4"></a>Saving kinemages</h3>
<!--l. 365--><p class="noindent">You can save kinemages using the <span 
class="pcrr8tn-">File | Save as </span>menu; these files are typically given the
extension <span 
class="pcrr8tn-">.kin</span>. KiNG will try to help you by automatically appending a number to the
filename so that your changes don&#8217;t overwrite your original. The resulting kinemage file
will be plain text that you can view and even edit by hand using any text editor
(though of course you don&#8217;t have to!). If you choose to do this and want use a word
processor (like Microsoft Word), make sure that you load and save the file in plain text
format.
<!--l. 374--><p class="indent">   Note that due to the security restrictions that web browsers place on Java applets, saving
will never be possible when KiNG is running inside a web browser.

 id="x1-270002.5"></a>Printing kinemages</h3>
<!--l. 381--><p class="noindent">You can use <span 
class="pcrr8tn-">File | Print </span>to send the image in the graphics area to your printer. The image
will fill as much of the page as possible without distorting it. The relative size of the elements
will be exactly the same as on screen. Among the consequences of this are that an image
printed from a small graphics window will have thicker lines when printed than will the
image when printed from a larger graphics window. Don&#8217;t worry about this too much; just
remember printing is WYSIWYG (what-you-see-is-what-you-get). If it looks right on the
screen, it should look right on the paper! Some images will fit better in landscape mode than
portrait mode; this decision is left up to the user.
<!--l. 393--><p class="indent">   Printing should work even when KiNG is running in a web browser, although the user
will generally be asked for permission first.

<!--l. 399--><p class="noindent">Several facilities are provided that can help get data out of kinemage format and into other
forms, either for making figures for publication or for further processing. Due to security
restrictions placed on applets, the export features are unavailable when KiNG is running in a

<!--l. 408--><p class="noindent">The <span 
class="pcrr8tn-">File | Export </span>menu allows one to save the current graphics image as a standard
image file. Image export requires that you have Java 1.4 or newer; otherwise, an
error message will appear. Several image formats are supported, including JPEG
and PNG; the format can be selected from the export dialog box. These images
are very useful for creating web pages, PowerPoint-style presentations, <span

high-quality publication graphics, however, you&#8217;ll want to use a vector-based format like
PDF.

 id="x1-300002.6.2"></a>Exporting vector graphics (PDF, PostScript, <span 
class="ptmri8t-">etc.</span>)</h4>
<!--l. 420--><p class="noindent">Rather than sending the image to the printer, it can be captured for inclusion in a publication
or later manipulation in a graphics program like Adobe Illustrator. Note that there are several
relevant options under the <span 
class="pcrr8tn-">Display </span>menu, particularly <span 
class="pcrr8tn-">White background </span>and
<span 
class="pcrr8tn-">Monochrome</span>.
<!--l. 426--><p class="indent">   All platforms can generate PDF files using the <span 
class="pcrr8tn-">File | Export </span>menu. This is the
simplest and best option for almost any use. &#8220;PDF&#8221; stands for Portable Document
Format, the successor to PostScript as the standard for vector graphics. You can learn
more about PDFs at <span class="obeylines-h"><a 
href="http://www.adobe.com" class="url" ><span 
class="pcrr8tn-">http://www.adobe.com</span></a></span>. It does require the (free) iText
PDF library from <span class="obeylines-h"><a 
href="http://www.lowagie.com/iText/" class="url" ><span 
class="pcrr8tn-">http://www.lowagie.com/iText/</span></a></span>, which is distributed with
KiNG.
<!--l. 434--><p class="indent">   If for some reason you don&#8217;t want to use PDF export, it is also often possible to hijack the
print output into a file. For instance, with Macintosh OS X, both PostScript and PDF output
are supported directly from the Print dialog. Under Linux, choosing <span 
class="pcrr8tn-">Print to file </span>from
the Print dialog will generate a PostScript file, which can be converted many other formats
using <span 
class="ptmri8t-">e.g. </span>Ghostscript tools like <span 
class="pcrr8tn-">ps2pdf </span>(PDF) and <span 
class="pcrr8tn-">ps2epsi </span>(EPS, Encapsulated PostScript).
Under Microsoft Windows, things don&#8217;t seem to be as straightforward, but one possiblity is
to install the generic PostScript printer drivers from Adobe and then direct this
&#8220;virtual printer&#8221; to FILE (rather than, <span 
class="ptmri8t-">e.g.</span>, LPT1). Your mileage may vary; I&#8217;d be
interested in hearing about better ways to do this from any Windows experts out
there.

<!--l. 517--><p class="noindent">Kinemages often include animations. An animation in this sense is not a movie, but more like
a flip-book, where similar images are aligned and displayed one at a time, in a series of
discrete frames. If a kinemage contains animation(s), there will be forward and
reverse buttons for the animation located below the checkboxes for groups and

<!--l. 527--><p class="noindent">The <span 
class="pcrr8tn-">Display </span>menu offers several options for controlling how the kinemage is rendered. Of
particular interest is the <span 
class="pcrr8tn-">Perspective </span>option. By default, KiNG renders objects with
orthographic perspective; objects near the viewer are no larger than those far away.
This is the preferred mode for viewing macromolecular structures and many 2-D
graphs and figures. However, for geometrical objects and other cases where the eye
expects perspective, enabling this option will result in a much more natural-looking
image.
<!--l. 536--><p class="indent">   There are also several ways of controlling the coloring of the points. Each point may have
its own color, and several &#8220;aspects&#8221; as well. For example, a map might be colored by the
aspects of temperature, elevation, and annual rainfall; one could then choose which of these
colorings to apply.
<!--l. 542--><p class="indent">   The first level of grouping above the individual point is the list; every point belongs to a
list. Points that don&#8217;t have a color specified take their color from the list, but there are times
when one might want to suppress the individual colors and color points by the color of the list
they belong to. This option is available as well.

 id="x1-400003.3.1"></a>Stereo</h4>

<!--l. 551--><p class="noindent">Upon request, KiNG will render the kinemage as a stereoscopic pair of images. The two
views are very nearly the same, except that one is slightly rotated with respect to the other.
If you can get one eye to look at each image, you can fool yourself into seeing
additional depth information. Stereo can be either &#8220;cross-eye&#8221; or &#8220;wall-eye&#8221;; the former
is somewhat easier to learn, but the later is more comfortable for long periods of
time.
<!--l. 559--><p class="indent">   To see cross-eye stereo, cross your eyes and then look at the screen without refocusing.
You should see 4 identical (though blurry) images. Relax your eyes slightly, and the center
two will overlap. If you can focus on this phantom central image, you&#8217;ll be seeing in stereo. It
may help bring the image into sharp focus to rotate the kinemage slighly using the
mouse.
<!--l. 566--><p class="indent">   If you&#8217;ve got KiNG set for wall-eye stereo and your eyes set for cross-eye (or vice versa),
you will see a stereoscopic image, but the parts that should be in back will be in front, and it
will rotate the wrong direction when you move the mouse. Change one or the other to get a
more reasonable image.
<!--l. 572--><p class="indent">   Incidentally, although KiNG doesn&#8217;t support multiple simultaneous views of the
same kinemage, you can simulate a pair of orthogonal views by setting the stereo
separation to 90 degrees in <span 
class="pcrr8tn-">Edit | Configure KiNG</span>. Of course, the views no longer
forms a stero image, but they&#8217;re useful in another way. Particularly applicable for
&#8220;info-vis&#8221; kinemages, you can examine (for instance) the x-y plane and the y-z plane at
the same time using this trick. It pairs well with the 90-degree rotations plugin
(<span 
class="ptmb8t-">??</span>).

   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">3.3.2    </span> <a 
 id="x1-410003.3.2"></a>OpenGL</h4>
<!--l. 584--><p class="noindent">KiNG is capable of using OpenGL rendering commands to take advantage of your
graphics hardware and get (hopefully) accelerated graphics performance. You&#8217;ll need
to have an up-to-date version of Java installed, along with the JOGL libraries (<span class="obeylines-h"><a 
href="https://jogl.dev.java.net/" class="url" ><span 
class="pcrr8tn-">https://jogl.dev.java.net/</span></a></span>). Make sure you get both <span 
class="pcrr8tn-">jogl.jar </span>and the native library
or libraries (they end in <span 
class="pcrr8tn-">.dll</span>, <span 
class="pcrr8tn-">.so</span>, or <span 
class="pcrr8tn-">.jnilib</span>). As of spring 2005, the JOGL folks were
distributing their native libraries packaged in a JAR file, too; they&#8217;ll need to be extracted with
a <span 
class="pcrr8tn-">jar xvf NATIVE-LIBS.JAR </span>command. You can remove the <span 
class="pcrr8tn-">META-INF </span>directory; it doesn&#8217;t
serve any purpose. The JOGL JAR file goes in <span 
class="pcrr8tn-">jre/lib/ext </span>of your Java installation, and
the native libraries go in <span 
class="pcrr8tn-">jre/bin </span>(Windows) or <span 
class="pcrr8tn-">jre/lib/i386 </span>(Linux). On Mac
OS X, all the files go in <span 
class="pcrr8tn-">/Library/Java/Extensions</span>. If you&#8217;re on a Unix-style
system (including Mac OS X), be sure to check your permissions as well. If you
downloaded a platform-specific version of KiNG, the necessary libraries may already be
included.
<!--l. 601--><p class="indent">   This feature has been tested with Java 1.4.2 and JOGL 1.1. JOGL is still under
development, as is this feature, and interacting so directly with the hardware is always risky,
so it&#8217;s possible that OpenGL rendering may hang KiNG on your computer. You&#8217;ve been
warned.
<!--l. 606--><p class="indent">   Hopefully, a future version of Java (possibly the 1.6.x series) will use OpenGL behind the
scenes for all graphics operations, making KiNG much faster and making this feature

obsolete. Until then, this is a work-around for large kinemages where performance is an
issue.

<!--l. 614--><p class="noindent">Not all the buttons to the right of the graphics control groups and subgroups of points; some
are &#8220;masters.&#8221; The master buttons sit below the others, separated by a spacer. When activated,
a master turns on all the groups it controls; when deactivated, it turns them all off. The effects
are only momentary; the group can be turned on or off directly regardless of the state of the
master(s) that control it.
<!--l. 622--><p class="indent">   A single group can be controlled by multiple masters. Note that the &#8220;off&#8221; state of a master
is dominant in this case: a master will always turn off the groups it controls, but will turn
them on only if they are not also controlled by another master that is already off. Since
the buttons of the individual groups, subgroups, and lists are sometimes hidden,
one can generate a variety of patterns by turning the masters on and off in specific
patterns.

<!--l. 633--><p class="noindent">Kinemage files are stored as human-readable, plain-text files. They&#8217;re also designed to be
easily edited by human beings, using a text editor like Notepad (Windows), TextEdit (Mac),
or vi (Unix). You can also use a word processor like Microsoft Word, but you have to be
careful to save as plain text (.txt) rather than formatted text (.doc and others). A description of
the kinemage file format is distributed with KiNG as a separate document from this
manual.
   <h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">4.1    </span> <a 
 id="x1-440004.1"></a>Merging kinemages together</h3>
<!--l. 644--><p class="noindent">The most basic sort of editing is to combine two kinemages into one. For this, simply use the
<span 
class="pcrr8tn-">File | Append </span>command (see&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x1-250002.3">2.3<!--tex4ht:ref: appending-a-kinemage --></a> on page&#x00A0;<span class="pageref"><a

   <h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">4.2    </span> <a 
 id="x1-450004.2"></a>Editing text</h3>
<!--l. 650--><p class="noindent">The text of a kinemage is often critical for clarifying and amplifying its meaning.
It&#8217;s analogous to the caption that accompanies a printed figure. You can edit the
kinemage text in the same window that you use for reading it (just press the <span 
class="pcrr8tn-">Show text</span>
button).

   <h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">4.3    </span> <a 
 id="x1-460004.3"></a>Editing views</h3>
<!--l. 658--><p class="noindent">A simple editing tool is <span 
class="pcrr8tn-">Views | Save current view</span>, which records the current
orientation and position of the kinemage as a new view in the <span 
class="pcrr8tn-">Views </span>menu. Creating a
series of meaningful, clearly labeled views is a great way to make a kinemage more
informative. You can delete, rename, and rearrange views using <span 
class="pcrr8tn-">Views | Edit saved</span>
<span 
class="pcrr8tn-">views</span>.
<!--l. 666--><p class="noindent">
   <h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">4.4    </span> <a 
 id="x1-470004.4"></a>The hierarchy editor</h3>
<!--l. 668--><p class="noindent">One of the goals of KiNG is to enable simple, visual editing of most parts of a kinemage.
Many of the editing commands are activated using a tree-like display of the hierarchical
kinemage structure, which will resemble the layout of buttons.
<!--l. 673--><p class="indent">   The structure of the kinemage can be rearranged by cutting, copying, and pasting
elements; creating new elements and deleting unneeded ones; and reordering elements (using
the <span 
class="pcrr8tn-">Up </span>and <span 
class="pcrr8tn-">Down </span>commands). Play with these commands, and their operation will soon
become obvious. Elements can even be cut out of one kinemage and pasted into
another!
<!--l. 680--><p class="indent">   Also, the properties of individual elements can be adjusted, which allows them to be
renamed. What other properties are available depends on the level of the hierarchy
(kinemage, group, subgroup, or list). Each element can also be toggled on and off, even if it

doesn&#8217;t have a button visible in the button pane.
<!--l. 686--><p class="indent">   Using the hierarchy editor effectively depends on a decent understanding of the kinemage
format. If you&#8217;re unfamiliar with kinemages, reading the kinemage format reference may be
very helpful to you.

   <h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">5.1    </span> <a 
 id="x1-490005.1"></a>Understanding the Tools and Plug-ins</h3>
<!--l. 696--><p class="noindent">The <span 
class="pcrr8tn-">Tools </span>menu has a variety of tools and plug-ins for interacting with the kinemage.
Many of these are highly domain-specific &#8212; tailored to doing structural biology, for
example. Each tool &#8220;takes over&#8221; the mouse, assigning specific meanings to the various
kinds of clicks and drags. Normally, the familiar Navigate tool is active, so mouse
motions result in the sort of rotations, pans, and zooms that most users are accustomed
to.
<!--l. 704--><p class="indent">   Plug-ins, on the other hand, just offer additional functionality that doesn&#8217;t change what
the mouse does. Because of this, you can have several plug-ins active at once, but only one
tool.
<!--l. 708--><p class="indent">   Some special-purpose tools and plugins have been developed by other people and ship
separately from KiNG. Installing these additional tools and plugins for KiNG is easy, though.
Just take all plugin files that end with <span 
class="pcrr8tn-">.jar </span>(<span 
class="ptmri8t-">e.g.</span>, <span 
class="pcrr8tn-">chiropraxis.jar</span>, <span 
class="pcrr8tn-">pyking.jar</span>) and put
them in the <span 
class="pcrr8tn-">plugins/ </span>folder that&#8217;s part of your KiNG distribution. There will probably be a
few JAR files in there already. Then just close KiNG and restart it to load the new
tools and plugins. Note that these will <span 
class="ptmri8t-">not </span>be available when running KiNG as an
applet.
<!--l. 718--><p class="indent">   The tools menu also has some other options that are related to how mouse clicks and
drags are interpretted, which are discussed below. The tools and plugins listed in the
menu can be rearranged, grouped into submenus, or hidden entirely by using the
<span 
class="pcrr8tn-">Tools | Customize </span>dialog box, which is also accessible from <span 
class="pcrr8tn-">Edit | Configure</span>
<span 
class="pcrr8tn-">KiNG</span>.
<!--l. 726--><p class="noindent">
   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">5.1.1    </span> <a 
 id="x1-500005.1.1"></a>Extra measurements</h4>
<!--l. 728--><p class="noindent">In addition to tracking the distance between the last two points, clicking on points to identify
them can track the angle between the last three points and the dihedral angle between the last
four. When these measurements are active, the <span 
class="pcrr8tn-">Markers </span>option will display four markers
instead of two.
<!--l. 735--><p class="noindent">
   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">5.1.2    </span> <a 
 id="x1-510005.1.2"></a>XYZ coordinates</h4>
<!--l. 737--><p class="noindent">Likewise, KiNG can display the original, unrotated coordinates of the point. This is
sometimes helpful when the kinemage is a graph or plot of some data, and the position has
some absolute meaning. The display of this information can be enabled in the <span 
class="pcrr8tn-">Tools</span>
menu.
<!--l. 744--><p class="noindent">
   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">5.1.3    </span> <a 
 id="x1-520005.1.3"></a>Pick objects</h4>

<!--l. 746--><p class="noindent">Traditionally, one can only &#8220;pick&#8221; points in a kinemage. Enabling this option allows KiNG to
recognize mouse clicks that hit the actual lines drawn between points and the surfaces of
triangles. In each case, the result is equivalent to clicking on the point that determines the
attributes (color, line width, etc.) of that graphics object.
<!--l. 753--><p class="noindent">
   <h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">5.2    </span> <a 
 id="x1-530005.2"></a>Using KiNG with a multi-button mouse</h3>
<!--l. 755--><p class="noindent">In KiNG, even a one-button mouse is sufficient to access all of the available functions.
However, it has also been designed to take full advantage of a three-button wheel mouse. The
primary function of every tool is accessed by clicking or dragging with the left (or only)
mouse button. This button is referred to as &#8220;Normal&#8221; in the command reference
charts.
<!--l. 762--><p class="indent">   Other functions can be accessed either by holding down keyboard keys at the same time,
or by using one of the other mouse buttons. Holding the Shift key is equivalent to using the
right mouse button, and holding the Control key (often written Ctrl) is equivalent to using the
middle mouse button. A few tools assign some function to a mouse action with both
the Shift and Control keys held down. In this case, you can get the same effect
when dragging by depressing both the left and right mouse button. Because of the
difficulty of clicking two buttons at once, however, this shortcut does not apply to
Shift+Ctrl+Click.
<!--l. 772--><p class="indent">   At the present time, the Shift and Control keys do not work properly in Java on Mac OS
X. When using a one-button mouse with OS X, you should use the Command key
(a.k.a. Open Apple) instead of Shift to get the same effect as the right mouse button,
and you should use the Option key (a.k.a. Alt) instead of Control to get the same
effect as the middle mouse button. Hopefully this will be fixed in OS X 10.4 / Java
1.5.
<!--l. 780--><p class="indent">   Some tools also use the up &amp; down arrow keys on the keyboard; these have the same
effect as using the scroll wheel of a wheel mouse. Once again, these may be combined with
the Shift and/or Control keys to give access to more functions. Note that the mouse wheel is
never active when running in a Java 1.3.x virtual machine; Java 1.4 or later is needed to take
advantage of this control.

<!--l. 790--><p class="noindent">The Navigate tool encompasses all the usual modes of interacting with a kinemage. This is
the tool that is active when KiNG is launched, and is probably the only tool many people will
ever use. See&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x1-100001.4.1">1.4.1<!--tex4ht:ref: basic-interaction --></a> on page&#x00A0;<span class="pageref"><a

kinemage. There are also a few more advanced modes of movement which are described
below.

<!--l. 800--><p class="noindent">Clicking and dragging (with the left mouse button) near the top of the graphics area will
cause the kinemage to spin around the Z axis like a pinwheel, rather than the more
conventional sort of rotation. This is sometimes useful for putting something right side
up.

<!--l. 808--><p class="noindent">Holding Control while dragging (or dragging with the middle mouse button) allows one to
slide the kinemage around in the plane of the screen. Dragging at the top of the screen, as
for z-rotation, slides the kinemage in and out of the plane of the screen. (Note:
enabling perspective in the <span 
class="pcrr8tn-">Diplay </span>menu is <span 
class="ptmri8t-">very </span>helpful when translating in and out
of the plane of the screen.) This sort of motion is sometimes called &#8220;panning&#8221; or
&#8220;flatland,&#8221; and can be made the default mode of movement by selecting <span

     is easier to see with Perspective enabled and Stereo on). A kinemage may have
     several &#8220;points&#8221; at the same location in 3-D. Under normal conditions, this tool
     will move them all together, so that lines stay connected and everything behaves
     just as you would expect. However, you can also use Ctrl+Drag to pick apart
     overlapped points and separate them from each other. You will need to activate

     the removed point. That is, lines drawn to and from the point will be removed,
     and all triangles involving the point will be removed. Sometimes kinemages have
     multiple points that overlap in the same spatial location, so it may take multiple

include X-PLOR (ASCII, not binary), O (DSN6 or Brix), and CCP4 (mode 2, the only one in
common use).
<!--l. 972--><p class="indent">   Each map opens a new control window, which allows adjustment of its extent, color,
and level. The segment of map that is visible at any given time is centered in the
current view; when the view changes, the portion that is visible will automatically be
updated.
<!--l. 977--><p class="indent">   Any dynamic segment of map can be "captured" as part of a static kinemage; just use the

When you&#8217;ve finished with a map, be sure to <span

consumed.
<!--l. 983--><p class="indent">   If you don&#8217;t have an electron density map for the structure you&#8217;re interested in, you can

<span

Users can also enter and modify URLs directly, though obviously this isn&#8217;t very

<!--l. 1006--><p class="noindent">The Update KiNG plugin allows you to quickly and easily update KiNG to the latest version
published on the Kinemage website (kinemage.biochem.duke.edu). After you confirm your
intentions, KiNG will begin downloading the new version. If the download proceeds too
slowly, you can cancel with no changes to KiNG. Once complete, the downloaded version
will be unpacked in the same place as your current installed version of KiNG, and the
existing version will be overwritten. You can then quit KiNG and restart to take advantage of
new features and capabilities.
<!--l. 1015--><p class="indent">   The Update plugin has been tested on a variety of platforms under a variety of conditions,
but there is always a chance that it won&#8217;t work quite right on <span 
class="ptmri8t-">your </span>computer. The chance is
greater if you created a non-standard custom installation from the JAR files rather than
using the pre-packaged platform-specific installer. If KiNG fails to start after the
update, you may have to remove it and then download and install a clean copy by
hand.
<!--l. 1023--><p class="indent">   There are certain things the automatic updater <span 
class="ptmri8t-">can&#8217;t </span>update, like the bundled binary
programs (<span 
class="pcrr8tn-">probe</span>, <span 
class="ptmri8t-">etc</span>.) or the displayed version number of the Mac application bundle. For
this reason, you may want to periodically remove the existing installation completely and
reinstall from scratch.

<!--l. 1032--><p class="noindent">By choosing <span 
class="pcrr8tn-">Edit | Configure KiNG</span>, one can adjust several aspects of KiNG&#8217;s behavior
and appearance, such as font sizes, stereo settings, and whether or not certain warnings are
issued. The configuration dialog also allows for reorganizing the <span 
class="pcrr8tn-">Tools </span>menu to suit your
own work habits. Preferrences may be saved to disk, where they are stored in a simple text
file named <span 
class="pcrr8tn-">.king_prefs </span>in the user&#8217;s home directory. There may be some settings accessible
only through this file; that is, they cannot be edited from the graphical interface.
Nonetheless, pressing <span

values.
<!--l. 1043--><p class="indent">   Note that due to security restrictions, configurations cannot be saved when KiNG is

<!--l. 1133--><p class="noindent">If you would like a custom image for the launcher, specify its URL with the <span

parameter. You may need to change the applet width/height to match. If no image is specified,
the default one will be used.
<!--l. 1138--><p class="indent">   Second, the applet can be embedded in the web page (rather than floating in its own
window), by placing this line inside the &lt;applet&gt; tags instead:
<!--l. 1142--><p class="noindent">
     <dl class="list1"><dt class="list">
     </dt><dd 
class="list">
     <span 
class="pcrr8tn-">&lt;param</span><span 
class="pcrr8tn-">&#x00A0;name=jmodej</span><span 
class="pcrr8tn-">&#x00A0;value=jflatj&gt;</span></dd></dl>
<!--l. 1145--><p class="noindent">One also probably wants to specify a larger width and/or height, possibly as a fraction of the page
size (<span 
class="ptmri8t-">e.g. </span>95%). Be warned that using KiNG this way may not work well in some browsers;
test your pages thoroughly.
<!--l. 1150--><p class="indent">   Normally, a KiNG applet displays only the kinemage specified in its <span 
class="pcrr8tn-">kinSource</span>
parameter. However, you can also use the <span 
class="pcrr8tn-">kinfileBase </span>and <span 
class="pcrr8tn-">kinfileList </span>parameters to
allow the user to open and/or append additional kinemages from a pre-specified set.
<span 
class="pcrr8tn-">kinfileBase </span>specifies a path to the maps relative to the current document base URL.
<span 
class="pcrr8tn-">kinfileList </span>is a space-separated list of filenames that can be loaded from that path.
Users can also enter and modify URLs directly, though obviously this isn&#8217;t very
convenient.

<!--l. 1159--><p class="indent">   The KiNG applet also supports a <span 
class="pcrr8tn-">kinfileSaveHandler </span>parameter, which is the
URL of a CGI script that can accept HTTP POST kinemage output. On a properly
configured webserver, this allows users of the KiNG applet to save their modified
kinemages directly to the server! However, this is definitely a custom programming
job on the server side and so is not an option for most &#8220;normal&#8221; uses of the KiNG
applet.

in their documentation.

<!--l. 1239--><p class="noindent">I owe an enormous debt of gratitude to many, many people for making this program possible.
First and foremost, I thank David and Jane Richardson, who are my bosses and mentors, and
who developed the kinemage concept, the file format, and most of the features found in KiNG
&#8212; my contribution was only the Java implementation. Second, I thank Vincent Chen for his
ongoing contributions to KiNG; he has developed many useful plugins and has made
significant contributions to the core. I am also grateful to the other members of the
Richardson lab, who have supported and encouraged me in developing KiNG, providing
invaluable insight into how to improve the program. Of course, this work would not have
been possible without support from the National Institutes of Health and the Howard Hughes
Medical Institute.
<!--l. 1252--><p class="indent">   KiNG is free software built on free software. I can&#8217;t hope to acknowledge all the
authors of all the software that has been used to create KiNG, but I can mention a few
of the most prominent: Sun Microsystems, the creators of the Java language and

libraries; the LY X document processor, used for writing the documentation; jEdit, a
fantastic programmer&#8217;s text editor written entirely in Java; and the entire Linux
movement, for providing a real alternative to comercial operating systems. I have also
taken advantage of a number of excellent free Java libraries, which are described
above.
