<P>A kinemage is a "kinetic image," a three-dimensional illustration
that lends itself to a variety of subjects. Kinemages were first
created as a way of visualizing macromolecular structures, particularly
x-ray crystal structures of proteins. Their strength is in <EM>selective</EM>
presentation of information --- they are intended as an alternative
to flat, static journal illustrations. Since their creation, kinemages
have been extended to a variety of other fields, from the social
sciences to education.</P>

<P>The kinemage concept is the brainchild of Drs. David and Jane
Richardson at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina, USA. Their
