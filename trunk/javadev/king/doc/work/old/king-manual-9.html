</H2>

<P>I owe an enormous debt of gratitude to many, many people for
making this program possible. First and foremost, I thank David and
Jane Richardson, who are my bosses and mentors, and who developed
the kinemage concept, the file format, and most of the features found
in KiNG --- my contribution was only the Java implementation. Second,
I am grateful to the other members of the Richardson lab, who have
supported and encouraged me in developing KiNG, providing invaluable
insight into how to improve the program.</P>

<P>KiNG is free software built on free software. I can't hope to
acknowledge all the authors of all the software that has been used
to create KiNG, but I can mention a few of the most prominent: Sun
Microsystems, the creators of the Java language and libraries; the
gnu.regexp project, which provides regular expression support to
KiNG; the LyX document processor, used for writing the documentation;
jEdit, a fantastic programmer's text editor written entirely in Java;
and of course RedHat and the entire Linux movement, for providing
what is arguably the best OS available today.</P>
