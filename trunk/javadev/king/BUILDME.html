<h1>BUILDME file for KiNG</h1>
<br>
KiNG is built using Apache Ant, which stores its configuration in <tt>build.xml</tt>.
Ant is the standard build tool for Java projects, like 'make' is for
C/C++. It is written in Java and works cross-platform, anywhere that
Java does. You can obtain Ant for free at <a
 href="http://ant.apache.org">http://ant.apache.org</a>. These build
files were written to work with Ant 1.5.2; if you have a newer version,
there may have been some changes to the file structure.<br>
<br>
To build the JAR and all the classfiles, rename the <tt>king-xxxx-src</tt>,
<tt>chiropraxis-xxxx-src</tt>,
and <tt>driftwood-xxxx-src</tt> directories to <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">king</span>, <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">chiropraxis</span>,
and <span style="font-family: monospace;">driftwood</span>,
respectively. Then enter the <span style="font-family: monospace;">king</span>
directory and type <span style="font-family: monospace;">ant dist</span>.
The
necessary Driftwood and Chiropraxis libraries will be built
automatically, followed by
compilation of the KiNG code, followed by the creation of <tt>king.jar</tt>
(which contains class files and resources from all three trees of code,
as
well as from the libraries included in the <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">lib</span> directory). The full KiNG
distribution package ZIP files will be generated in <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">king/dist</span>. If you'd prefer to
just compile the code and build the JAR files (and stop there), use the
command <span style="font-family: monospace;">ant build</span>
instead. The <span style="font-family: monospace;">build.xml</span>
files also contain several other targets (<span
 style="font-family: monospace;">deploy-<span
 style="font-style: italic;">xxx</span></span><span
 style="font-style: italic;"> </span>and <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">backup</span>, for instance) that are
intended only for the use of the primary developer(s). Feel free to
modify these so they do something useful on your machine.<br>
<br>
KiNG uses some other open-source
libraries, which are included in the <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">lib</span> directory for your
convenience. Note that their licensing terms may differ substantially
from KiNG's; see those distributions for details. If you would like to
obtain updated versions of these libraries or simply get more
information about them, you can visit their websites. The GNU regular
expressions package
<span style="font-family: monospace;">gnu.regexp</span> is available
from <a href="http://www.cacas.org/java/gnu/regexp/">http://www.cacas.org/java/gnu/regexp/</a>,
and the iText PDF-creation library is available from <a
 href="http://www.lowagie.com/iText/">http://www.lowagie.com/iText/</a>.<br>
