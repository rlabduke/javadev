==============================================================================
===  TO DO  ==================================================================
==============================================================================
    Deal with NMR 'Q' atoms in AtomGraph
    Don't bond metals/ions/"weird" atoms to anything?
    Allow disabling cache for getCovalentNeighbors (?)
    Create PLOptimizer that reorders Bonds to minimize the number of 'P' points

==============================================================================
===  CHANGE LOG  =============================================================
==============================================================================

### 0.04 ###
- string interning in moldb seems to have sped things up across the board,
  though I'm not sure why -- maybe faster comparisons somewhere?

### 0.03 ###
- refactored Test to accept either PDB or mmCIF input
- stopped Test from printing xxxlists when there is no content
- created KingMoleculeImporter as a plugin to load PDBs/mmCIFs directly in KiNG
  It uses Test to do its drawing and (at the moment) is not configurable.
- changed AtomGraph and Util.selectBondsBetween() to return a Collection of
  Bond objects, rather than a SortedSet. AtomGraph still uses TreeSet, but
  Util uses ArrayList b/c it's faster/cheaper and the Bonds are already sorted.
- tested importing 1JJ2 (lg. ribosomal subunit) into KiNG -- works pretty well,
  except that some hets are "bonded" to protein (same for 1BOV and others...)

### 0.02 ###
- added isSS(), isDisulfide() to Util
- added selectBondsBetween() to Util
- added getCovalentUnbonded() to AtomGraph
- added segregation by atom type and lots-like drawing to Test

### 0.01 ###
- created AtomGraph, Bond, Util
- created Test to do quick-and-dirty tests of the basic functions
- using Unix TIME, tested vs. Prekin on 1JJ2 -- comparable speed.
  Slower on 1UBQ, probably due to JITing (and other overhead?)
