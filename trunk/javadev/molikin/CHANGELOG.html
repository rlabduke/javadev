==============================================================================
===  TO DO  ==================================================================
==============================================================================
    Weird PDBs:
        1ACX - weird geom leads to weird bonding patterns
        We could modify AtomGroup.connectHeavyAtoms()
        to keep only the N shortest bonds...
    Deal with NMR 'Q' atoms in AtomGraph
    Allow disabling cache for getCovalentNeighbors (?)
    Check Prekin's NAList and AAList to make sure we have all entries...
    Look at TR0001 for bb/sc -- some bb atoms are called sc
        _CM2 for OMC, OMG; OP3 for terminus
    do pointmasters for alt confs
    color by residue type (each AA, base, etc has its own color)
    plugin - set kin as modified!
    waters should be peachtint?

===  CHANGE LOG  =============================================================
==============================================================================

### 0.09 ###
### 0.09 ###
- modified the GUI to iterate models, chains at top level; not per panel
  This keeps colors consistent and pieces grouped together.
  Changes to moldb2.Model make the chains come out in order, too.
- changed defaults for BallAndStickPane
- tr0001 OMC 32 caught a possible endless loop in BondOptimizer.extendLeft()
- added pluggable point IDs and matched default to Prekin output
- added check for whether half-bond midpoint is actually needed
- added ability to remove a DrawingPane from the GUI, or to remove all
- added Util.getVdwRadius(), based on Probe's atomprops.h
- added gui.VanDerWaalsPane to do ball/sphere vdW renderings
- created much nicer interface for KiNG plugin; removed old one
- tweaked layout on MainGuiPane

### 0.08 ###
- changed sort order of Bonds to work better with:
- added Util.optimizeBondSequence() for cleaner kinemages
- experimenting with up-front optimization of the set of all bonds shows this
  doesn't improve kinemage connectivity once bonds are broken into mc, sc, etc.
- added Bond.reverse() to facilitate optimizing the connectivity. Is this a good idea???
- NO! added "mirror" field to Bond instead, so they remain immutable.
- elaborated on Util.selectBondsBetween() based on StickPrinter experience
- added BondOptimizer, which can now truly maximize the connectedness
  Adding calls to this from StickPrinter actually speeds things up, as well as
  reduces the size of the kinemage file.
- streamlined the operation of BallAndStickPane a bit
- added PseudoBackbone for doing C-alpha traces and DNA/RNA pseudo bb.
- finished implementation of pseudo-backbone and C-alpha traces
- mocked up a (non-functional) full GUI screen
- finished work on main GUI screen (for the time being); it seems to work well

### 0.07 ###
- simplified StickPrinter and made it significantly faster (!)
- added halfbond capability to StickPrinter
- Oops! Putative speed-up was just a bug (not drawing any sidechains).
  Still, StickPrinter is simplified with no measurable performance penalty.
- improved SelectorPane layout constraints
- added BallAndStickPane; controls are not functional yet
- changed selection API slightly in SelectorPane
- added DataCache for caching calculated geometry data for each model
- added Sets of Residues to ResClassifier
- started moving printing logic out of Test and into BallAndStickPane;
  protein drawing is now working in BallAndStickPane
- simplified BallPrinter
- completed all drawing in BallAndStickPane except pseudobb and atom balls
- added getElement() and getElementColor() to Util
- added BallAndStickPane.printAtomBalls() and hooked it up to the GUI
- moved the "covalent" naming out of AtomGraph and into DataCache.
  This allows us to easily make AtomGraph an abstract class in the future,
  instances of which might concern covalent bonds, H-bonds, etc etc.

### 0.06 ###
- fixed isX() typo bugs in Util
- added BallPrinter
- further subdivided atoms in AtomClassifier
- added BondCrayon, AtomCrayon, and ConstCrayon
- modified BallPrinter and StickPrinter to take a Crayon object
- added primitive SelectorPane and tested it for selecting sc to draw
- added ResRanger for managing range selection statements
- added range support to SelectorPane and coupled List to TextField
- fixed inclusive/exclusive index issue with BitSet in ResRanger
- text field selections are now coupled to the list
- testing against 1RTU, 1EMA: the protein MODRES is pink (het) but still
  connected as it should be ... this seems like a reasonable result.
  Plus, I can't fix it without screwing up other hets!

### 0.05 ###
- added isProtein, isNucleicAcid, and isIon to Util
- added ResClassifier to decide protein/nucleic/ion/water/het
- added AtomClassifier to decide bb/sc and heavy/H
- added BondClassifier to get standard kinemage groupings (bb/sc, prot/het)
- added some extra sets to AtomClassifier for convenience
- rewrote Test in terms of the new classes -- shorter and cleaner
- removed BondClassifier; on further thought, it's not necessary

### 0.04 ###
- string interning in moldb seems to have sped things up across the board,
  though I'm not sure why -- maybe faster comparisons somewhere?
- updated Test b/c driftwood.moldb2.ModelGroup became CoordinateFile

### 0.03 ###
- refactored Test to accept either PDB or mmCIF input
- stopped Test from printing xxxlists when there is no content
- created KingMoleculeImporter as a plugin to load PDBs/mmCIFs directly in KiNG
  It uses Test to do its drawing and (at the moment) is not configurable.
- changed AtomGraph and Util.selectBondsBetween() to return a Collection of
  Bond objects, rather than a SortedSet. AtomGraph still uses TreeSet, but
  Util uses ArrayList b/c it's faster/cheaper and the Bonds are already sorted.
- tested importing 1JJ2 (lg. ribosomal subunit) into KiNG -- works pretty well,
  except that some hets are "bonded" to protein (same for 1BOV and others...)

### 0.02 ###
- added isSS(), isDisulfide() to Util
- added selectBondsBetween() to Util
- added getCovalentUnbonded() to AtomGraph
- added segregation by atom type and lots-like drawing to Test

### 0.01 ###
- created AtomGraph, Bond, Util
- created Test to do quick-and-dirty tests of the basic functions
- using Unix TIME, tested vs. Prekin on 1JJ2 -- comparable speed.
  Slower on 1UBQ, probably due to JITing (and other overhead?)
